      "NarrativeText: Abstract. Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were hit by extreme precipitation and ﬂooding in July 2021. This brief communication provides an overview of the impacts to large-scale critical infrastructure systems and how recovery has progressed. The results show that Germany and Belgium were particularly affected, with many infrastructure assets severely damaged or completely destroyed. Impacts range from completely destroyed bridges and sewage systems, to severely damaged schools and hospitals. We ﬁnd that (large- scale) risk assessments, often focused on larger (river) ﬂood events, do not ﬁnd these local, but severe, impacts due to crit- ical infrastructure failures. This may be the result of limited availability of validation material. As such, this brief com- munication not only will help to better understand how criti- cal infrastructure can be affected by ﬂooding, but also can be used as validation material for future ﬂood risk assessments.\n",
      "NarrativeText: the Eiffel National Park, to the city of Trier. Flooding in Belgium was concentrated in the Vesdre River valley (dis- tricts of Pepinster, Ensival and Verviers), the Meuse River valley (Maaseik, Liége), the Gete River valley (Herk-de-Stad and Halen) and southeast Brussels (Wavre). The Netherlands experienced ﬂooding, mostly concentrated in the southern district of Limburg. In total, at least 220 casualties have been reported, with insured loss estimates of approximately EUR150 million–EUR250 million in the Netherlands (Ver- bond voor Verzekeraars, 2022), ∼EUR2.2 billion in Bel- gium (Assuralia, 2022) and ∼EUR8.2 billion (GDV, 2022) in Germany. The event caused major damages to residential and commercial structures and to many critical infrastruc- ture (CI) assets. Not only vital functions for ﬁrst responders were affected (e.g. hospitals, ﬁre departments), but also rail- ways, bridges and utility networks (e.g. water and electricity supply) were severely damaged, expecting to take months to years to fully rebuild.\n",

      "NarrativeText: In mid-July 2021, a persistent low-pressure system caused extreme precipitation in parts of the Belgian, German and Dutch catchments of the Meuse and Rhine rivers. This led to record-breaking water levels and severe ﬂooding (Mohr et al., 2022). Comparable heavy precipitation events in this area have never been registered in most of the affected areas before (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). The German states most af- fected include Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz), with damage to the Ahr River valley (Ahrtal), several regions in\n",
      "NarrativeText: CI is often considered to be the backbone of a well- functioning society (Hall et al., 2016), which is particularly eminent during natural hazards and disasters. For instance, failure of electricity or telecommunication services immedi- ately causes disruptions in the day-to-day functioning of peo- ple and businesses, including those outside the directly af- fected area. Despite the (academic) agreement that failure of infrastructure systems may cause (large-scale) societal dis- ruptions (Garschagen and Sandholz, 2018; Hallegatte et al., 2019; Fekete and Sandholz, 2021), empirical evidence on the impacts of extreme weather events on these systems is still\n",

We conclude with suggestions on moving forward in CI risk modelling, based on the lessons learned from this extreme event.\n",

      "NarrativeText: In Germany, road and railway infrastructure was severely damaged as documented exemplarily in Fig. 1. Cost esti- mates reach up to EURO2 billion Euro (MDR, 2021). More than 130km of motorways were closed directly after the event, of which 50km were still closed two months later, with an estimated repair cost of EUR100 million (Hauser, 2021). Of the 112 bridges in the ﬂooded 40km of the Ahr valley (Rhineland-Palatinate), 62 bridges were destroyed, 13 were severely damaged and only 35 were in operation a month after the ﬂood event (MDR, 2021). Over 74km of roads, paths and bridges in the Ahr valley have been (critically) damaged. In some cases, repairs are expected to take months to years (Zeit Online, 2021). For example, ma- jor freeway sections, including parts of the A1 motorway, were closed until early 2022 (24Rhein, 2022). In addition, about 50000 cars were damaged, causing insurance claims of some EUR450 million (ADAC, 2021). The German railway provider Deutsche Bahn expects asset damages of around EUR1.3 billion. Among other things, 180 level crossings, almost 40 signal boxes, over 1000 catenary and signal masts, and 600km of tracks were destroyed, as well as energy sup- ply systems, elevators and lighting systems (MDR, 2021). As of 11 April 2022, 14 of the affected rail stretches are fully functional again. The less damaged stretches were func- tional again within 3 months, while some of the most dam- aged sections in the Ahr valley are expected to be ﬁnished by the end of 2025 (DB, 2022). In Belgium, approximately 10km of railway tracks and 3000 sleeper tracks have to be re- placed; 50km of catenary needs to be repaired; and 70000t of railway track bed needs to be placed, with estimated costs between EUR30 million–EUR50 million (Rozendaal, 2021a). Most damages have been repaired within 2 weeks. The most severely damaged railway line (between the vil- lages of Spa and Pepinster) was reopened again on 3 Octo- ber 2021 (Rozendaal, 2021b). In the Netherlands, no large- scale damage has been reported to transport infrastructure. A few national highways were partly ﬂooded (e.g. the A76 in both directions) or brieﬂy closed (<3d) because of the po- tential of ﬂooding. Most likely due to relative low-ﬂow ve- locities, damage to Dutch national road infrastructure was limited. Several railway sections were closed (e.g. the rail-\n",

      "Title: 2.2 Electricity and gas supply\n",
      "NarrativeText: At the peak of the event, around 200000 people experienced power outages in Germany. Electricity infrastructure was severely damaged in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland- Palatinate. However, within 2d around 50% of the power was restored through repairs and temporary ﬁxes. Within 8 weeks, no emergency power generators were required any- more, with most of the power infrastructure restored in Ger- many’s affected areas. Some areas, however, only had perma- nent power infrastructure after 6 months (Westnetz, 2022). The gas distribution network in the Ahr valley was severely damaged. Approximately 133km of natural gas pipelines, 8500 gas metres, 3400 house pressure regulators, 7220 of the approximately 8000 household connections, and 31 systems measuring and regulating gas pressure have been damaged or destroyed (SWR, 2021). Gas supply was almost fully re- stored within 4.5 months after the ﬂood event (Energienetze Mittelrhein, 2021). In Belgium, approximately 41500 peo- ple experienced power outages at the peak of the event. This was the result of both damaged and deliberately switched- off electrical cabinets to prevent serious damages. It took around 3 weeks to fully restore power. Similar to Germany, severe damage had been observed to the gas network. In the villages around Liége, such as Chaudfontaine and Pepinster (Belgium), gas supply was fully recovered within 5 months (Grosjean, 2021; De Wolf, 2021). In the Netherlands, 1000– 2000 households experienced a loss of electricity supply at the peak of the event. Between 100 to 200 households had no gas supply. Within several days, electricity supply was re- stored (Task Force Fact Finding Hoogwater, 2021).\n",

      "NarrativeText: In the region of Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), most drink- ing water supply was restored within 2 months (Hochwasser Ahr, 2021a). However, sewage treatment plants in Alte- nahr, Mayschoss and Sinzig had been largely destroyed (Hochwasser Ahr, 2021b), and it is expected to take at least 1.5 years to fully repair most sewage treatment plants. Emer- gency sewage treatment plants have been built in the mean- time (GA, 2021). In the Erft region 7 out of 31 wastewater facilities had been destroyed. Many facilities reported pollu- tion of oil and diesel, forming layers up to 15cm thick (Kuhn, 2021). In addition, much of the groundwater (and soil) in the ﬂood region was mixed with oil (from destroyed residen- tial oil tanks), chemicals such as fertilizers (from wineries and other agriculture) and chemicals from nearby industrial plants. In Sinzig, 3.6×106 L of oil–water mixture was re- cycled, gaining 3600m3 of oil, to be reused for heating and\n",

In the heavily destroyed town of Bad Münstereifel (in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia), drinking water supply was re-established within 5d after the ﬂood event (most frequently through emergency tanks), and about 50% of the city centre was reconnected to the fresh- water network shortly thereafter however, water had to be boiled before consumption until about 1 month later (Bad Münstereifel, 2021). In Belgium, several towns experienced disruptions in water supply (in particular as a result of pol- lution). Directly after the event, approximately 3400 families had no access to potable water. Within less than a week, this was reduced to around 1650 families (Terzake, 2021). It took, however, 6 months to rebuild the permanent water supply in- frastructure (SWDE, 2022). In the Netherlands, little to no problems have been recorded with regards to water supply.\n",

      "NarrativeText: We found no information regarding direct impact on solid- waste facilities as a result of the ﬂood event. However, there is a large pressure on the solid-waste sector to clean the af- fected areas; 1 month after the event, we observed dozens of large temporary waste ﬁlls and frequent incidences of oil pollution in Rhineland-Palatinate during a ﬁeld visit. In the Ahrweiler district alone, the ﬂood caused as much solid waste as normally would be collected over 30 years. In Belgium, the amount of solid waste is estimated around 160000t, stored at several places, such as the abandoned highway track A601. This highway has been used for approx- imately 9 months as a temporary storage for debris (Cou- plez, 2022). In the Netherlands, there have been primarily problems with waste deposits along the river banks, which is mostly the solid waste transported by the river from fur- ther upstream.

      "Title: 2.5 Telecommunication\n",
      "NarrativeText: In Germany, all severely affected areas experienced dis- ruption of mobile network services. Within the region of Rhineland-Palatinate, it took 2 weeks to ensure 100% cover- age again through emergency communication masts. Within 1 month, most of the network was restored to pre-disaster ser- vice provision. After 5 months, broadband has also been re- stored in the most affected areas, which started in most areas only after power infrastructure was rebuilt (Westnetz, 2021). In Belgium, it has taken around 11 months to restore connec- tion to the last communities within the affected area. In the Netherlands, approximately 7000 households were affected by disrupted telecommunication service. This was primarily due to ﬂooded telecommunication infrastructure in the direct vicinity of ﬂooded houses. However, some distribution cab- inets were ﬂooded as well, with the largest ﬂooded cabinet affecting around 700 households. Due to damaged bridges, several ﬁbre cables were damaged. Five telecommunication masts were affected as well, but “tuning” of the network ensured that the service disruption was kept to a minimum (Task Force Fact Finding Hoogwater, 2021).\n",

Af- ter 1.5 months, medical care was guaranteed again in the most affected regions in Rhineland-Palatinate (Hochwasser Ahr, 2021c). In the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, approx- imately 68 hospitals have been affected, of which several have been affected severely and will take at least 1.5 years to be rebuilt (Fig. 2). Direct damages are estimated to be at least EUR100 million to repair all medical facilities (Ko- rzilius, 2021). In the town of Eschweiler (Germany), for ex- ample, the basement of the hospital was ﬂooded, as well as the outbuildings and the entire outdoor area. The power sup- ply collapsed, the entire building technology was destroyed and some 300 patients had to be evacuated by helicopter. Property damage is expected to be around EUR50 million. Within 3.5 weeks, the hospital was partly operational, and within 3 months, all hospital operations continued normally (SAH Eschweiler, 2021). The Mutterhaus Ehrang hospital in Trier (Germany) is now permanently closed as the hospital is too severely damaged to rebuild. Furthermore, in the region of Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), 19 daycare centres and 17 schools suffered damage from the ﬂoods, affecting more than 8000 students (Staib, 2021). Approximately 4 months after the ﬂood event, the district of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler established emergency educational facilities using 297 con- tainers that serve as classrooms, ofﬁces and dining facilities for more than 800 students (Wiesbadener Kurier, 2021). In Belgium, various rural clinics have been affected and were unable to provide any services. Concurrently, in the most af- fected areas, general-practitioner facilities have been com- pletely destroyed (Le Spécialiste, 2021). In the Netherlands, one nursing home was ﬂooded, and one hospital was evacu- ated as a precautionary measure.\n",

Van Ginkel et al. (2021) assessed river ﬂood risk for all road segments in Europe. Of the eight motorway ﬂoods incidents in Germany reported by Hauser (2021), three are recognizable as ﬂood hotspots in van Ginkel et al. (2021). During the event in 2021, most damage was caused by rel- atively small rivers which are only represented in the haz- ard data from the point that the upstream catchment is above 500km2. For example, the Ahr valley is partly covered (400 of the 900km2) by van Ginkel et al., 2021, who estimate the road repair costs at EUR4 million to EUR29 million (under low- and high-ﬂow velocities respectively.) for a 1 : 500 year event. The ﬁeld visit showed damage caused by high-ﬂow velocities at multiple places, and video footage of the events suggests these are locally more towards 2ms−1, which van\n",

      "NarrativeText: Ginkel et al. (2021) considered “high-ﬂow velocity”, than towards 0.2ms−1, which they considered “low-ﬂow veloc- ity”. At ﬁrst sight, the spatial extent of the exposed assets has reasonable correspondence to the model of van Ginkel et al. (2021). However, the model ignores bridge damage, which in reality was a major source of damage (Sect. 2.1). Also, a signiﬁcant share of observed damage resulted from pluvial ﬂooding, ﬂash ﬂooding and landslides which was not captured by van Ginkel et al. (2021).\n",
      "NarrativeText: Reconnaissance observations (August 2021) along the rivers Ahr and Erft (Lemnitzer et al., 2022) documented se- vere, as well as irreparable, damage to bridges designed and constructed within the last 2 decades and total destruction of almost all historical bridges, typically constructed on shallow foundations. Historical bridge designs concentrated primar- ily on cross-sectional requirements for expected water vol- umes. Triggered by ﬂood events in the past four decades, bridge design research has broadened by focusing on risk- based scour assessment, hydrodynamic pier designs, reduc- tion of intermediate bridge support elements, impact and col- lision loading, implementation of bridge protection mecha- nisms such as from wood debris, and machine learning ap- proaches from past failures (VAW 188, 2006; Bento et al., 2020; Majtan et al., 2021; Naser, 2021). Accounting for all these mechanisms, however, is complex (Haehnel and Daly, 2004) and no guarantee to avoid the observed failures. Var- ious international design codes (e.g. American bridge stan- dard AASHTO, Australian bridge standard AS5100, and Japanese bridge standard SHB) provide quantitative tools to assess impact loading from debris/tree logs; however, bridges erected prior to recent design requirements are unable to maintain global structural stability under the excessive mul- tidirectional loading, such as seen in the 2021 ﬂoods. Based on ﬁeld observations, the advancement of erosion prevention practices for ﬂood events emerged as a critical research fo- cus, as the interface stability between water, soil and foun- dation elements was found to be compromised at almost all bridge damage locations visited.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Next to the above insights into modelling direct physical damages, we can also use the observation from the event to further improve and validate our assumptions on post- disaster (infrastructure) recovery. In particular, when mod- elling the economic and societal impacts, the recovery pro- cess is one of the most important drivers of losses (e.g. Koks et al., 2015). The July 2021 event has given us several in- sights. Firstly, there is a prioritization between different in- frastructure systems. In Germany, for example, we found that in several affected areas the electricity network was repaired ﬁrst, which was subsequently followed by the gas and broad- band network. Secondly, there is a prioritization within in- frastructure systems. For example, more critical roads are re- paired sooner than less critical roads. While this may sound obvious, academic studies often consider a recovery of the entire system, without considering a speciﬁc order of im- portance. Finally, good recovery management practices and\n",

      "NarrativeText: enough trades(wo)men (e.g. electricians, utility workers) are one of the most important drivers of a speedy and successful recovery. These are often not included within the modelling assumptions.\n",
      "NarrativeText: 4 Moving forward\n",
      "NarrativeText: Based on our ﬁndings, we highlight three aspects to move forward in the ﬁeld of infrastructure disaster risk assess- ments. First, merely focusing on ﬂood extent and depth is not sufﬁcient to estimate the impacts of extreme ﬂood events to infrastructure. In particular, in Germany and Belgium, it became evident that the high discharge and streamﬂow and corresponding high-ﬂow velocities (resulting from the lo- cal topography and the intensity of the rainfall) are a de- cisive factor in explaining the degree of destruction. Many of the observed failures such as bridge scour, road embank- ment instabilities and erosion of aggregate foundations could likely better be explained from ﬂow velocity rather than ﬂood depth. Future ﬂood impact studies, especially those focusing on transport infrastructure, should aim to account for ﬂow velocity in their impact modelling, in particular in areas with steep gradients.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Second, the observed impacts on CI highlight the inﬂu- ence of spatial scale on the magnitude of the impacts. On a local and regional level, the disruptions in daily lives and to the economy were enormous. Yet, zoomed out on a national scale, the impacts were relatively small. While large-scale studies are useful to identify potential hotspots and bottle- necks in the system, local-scale studies are essential to better understand the real impacts (and are also better able to do so). This is true for both the consequences to infrastructure assets and the services and the impacts on lives and livelihoods.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Finally, the level of destruction and disruption caused by this event highlights the need for the development of both asset and system-level adaptation measures, securing more resilient infrastructure systems. Extreme weather events are expected to become more likely not only in western Europe, but also globally in an increasingly warmer world. As such, there is an urgency to investigate not only how service provi- sion can be ensured in the case of an extreme event but also how the recovery process to a minimum service level can be as swift and smooth as possible. This calls for a further collaboration between the different sectors of reliability and systems engineering and disaster risk modelling and manage- ment. The limited number of studies on impact on CI due to ﬂooding highlights the need for more detailed infrastructure failure impact assessments including cascading impacts.\n",

    "extreme precipitation in parts of the Belgian, German and\n",
    "Dutch catchments of the Meuse and Rhine rivers. This led\n",
    "to record-breaking water levels and severe flooding (Mohr\n",
    "et al., 2022). Comparable heavy precipitation events in this\n",
    "area have never been registered in most of the affected areas\n",
    "before (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). The German states most affected\n",
    "include Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz), with\n",
    "damage to the Ahr River valley (Ahrtal), several regions in\n",
    "the Eiffel National Park, to the city of Trier. Flooding in\n",
    "Belgium was concentrated in the Vesdre River valley (districts\n",
    "of Pepinster, Ensival and Verviers), the Meuse River\n",
    "valley (Maaseik, Liége), the Gete River valley (Herk-de-Stad\n",
    "and Halen) and southeast Brussels (Wavre). The Netherlands\n",
    "experienced flooding, mostly concentrated in the southern\n",
    "district of Limburg. In total, at least 220 casualties have\n",
    "been reported, with insured loss estimates of approximately\n",
    "EUR 150 million–EUR 250 million in the Netherlands (Verbond\n",
    "voor Verzekeraars, 2022), EUR 2.2 billion in Belgium\n",
    "(Assuralia, 2022) and EUR 8.2 billion (GDV, 2022)\n",
    "in Germany. The event caused major damages to residential\n",
    "and commercial structures and to many critical infrastructure\n",
    "(CI) assets. Not only vital functions for first responders\n",
    "were affected (e.g. hospitals, fire departments), but also railways,\n",
    "bridges and utility networks (e.g. water and electricity\n",
    "supply) were severely damaged, expecting to take months to\n",
    "years to fully rebuild.\n",
    "CI is often considered to be the backbone of a wellfunctioning\n",
    "society (Hall et al., 2016), which is particularly\n",
    "eminent during natural hazards and disasters. For instance,\n",
    "failure of electricity or telecommunication services immediately\n",
    "causes disruptions in the day-to-day functioning of people\n",
    "and businesses, including those outside the directly affected\n",
    "area. Despite the (academic) agreement that failure of\n",
    "infrastructure systems may cause (large-scale) societal disruptions\n",
    "(Garschagen and Sandholz, 2018; Hallegatte et al.,\n",
    "2019; Fekete and Sandholz, 2021), empirical evidence on the\n",
    "impacts of extreme weather events on these systems is still\n",
    "Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n",
    "3832 E. E. Koks et al.: Flood impacts to infrastructure\n",
    "limited. This brief communication provides an overview of\n",
    "the observed flood impacts to large-scale infrastructure systems\n",
    "during the 2021 mid-July western European flood event\n",
    "and how reconstruction of these large-scale systems has progressed.\n",
    "Next, we highlight how some of these observations\n",
    "compare to academic modelling approaches. We conclude\n",
    "with suggestions on moving forward in CI risk modelling,\n",
    "based on the lessons learned from this extreme event.\n",
    "2 Critical infrastructure impacts\n",
    "2.1 Transport infrastructure\n",
    "In Germany, road and railway infrastructure was severely\n",
    "damaged as documented exemplarily in Fig. 1. Cost estimates\n",
    "reach up to EURO2 billion Euro (MDR, 2021). More\n",
    "than 130 km of motorways were closed directly after the\n",
    "event, of which 50 km were still closed two months later,\n",
    "with an estimated repair cost of EUR100 million (Hauser,\n",
    "2021). Of the 112 bridges in the flooded 40 km of the Ahr\n",
    "valley (Rhineland-Palatinate), 62 bridges were destroyed,\n",
    "13 were severely damaged and only 35 were in operation\n",
    "a month after the flood event (MDR, 2021). Over 74 km\n",
    "of roads, paths and bridges in the Ahr valley have been\n",
    "(critically) damaged. In some cases, repairs are expected to\n",
    "take months to years (Zeit Online, 2021). For example, major\n",
    "freeway sections, including parts of the A1 motorway,\n",
    "were closed until early 2022 (24Rhein, 2022). In addition,\n",
    "about 50 000 cars were damaged, causing insurance claims of\n",
    "some EUR 450 million (ADAC, 2021). The German railway\n",
    "provider Deutsche Bahn expects asset damages of around\n",
    "EUR 1.3 billion. Among other things, 180 level crossings,\n",
    "almost 40 signal boxes, over 1000 catenary and signal masts,\n",
    "and 600 km of tracks were destroyed, as well as energy supply\n",
    "systems, elevators and lighting systems (MDR, 2021).\n",
    "As of 11 April 2022, 14 of the affected rail stretches are\n",
    "fully functional again. The less damaged stretches were functional\n",
    "again within 3 months, while some of the most damaged\n",
    "sections in the Ahr valley are expected to be finished\n",
    "by the end of 2025 (DB, 2022). In Belgium, approximately\n",
    "10 km of railway tracks and 3000 sleeper tracks have to be replaced;\n",
    "50 km of catenary needs to be repaired; and 70 000 t\n",
    "of railway track bed needs to be placed, with estimated\n",
    "costs between EUR 30 million–EUR 50 million (Rozendaal,\n",
    "2021a). Most damages have been repaired within 2 weeks.\n",
    "The most severely damaged railway line (between the villages\n",
    "of Spa and Pepinster) was reopened again on 3 October\n",
    "2021 (Rozendaal, 2021b). In the Netherlands, no largescale\n",
    "damage has been reported to transport infrastructure. A\n",
    "few national highways were partly flooded (e.g. the A76 in\n",
    "both directions) or briefly closed (<3 d) because of the potential\n",
    "of flooding. Most likely due to relative low-flow velocities,\n",
    "damage to Dutch national road infrastructure was\n",
    "limited. Several railway sections were closed (e.g. the railway\n",
    "section between Maastricht and Liége) and some damage\n",
    "occurred to the railway infrastructure, in particular to the\n",
    "electronic “track circuit” devices and saturated railway embankments\n",
    "(Prorail, 2021).\"\"\"\n",
