This\\\\nbrief communication provides an overview of the impacts to\\\\nlarge-scale critical infrastructure systems and how recovery\\\\nhas progressed. The results show that Germany and Belgium\\\\nwere particularly affected, with many infrastructure assets\\\\nseverely damaged or completely destroyed. Impacts range\\\\nfrom completely destroyed bridges and sewage systems, to\\\\nseverely damaged schools and hospitals. We \\\\ufb01nd that (large-\\\\nscale) risk assessments, often focused on larger (river) \\\\ufb02ood\\\\nevents, do not \\\\ufb01nd these local, but severe, impacts due to crit-\\\\nical infrastructure failures. This may be the result of limited\\\\navailability of validation material. As such, this brief com-\\\\nmunication not only will help to better understand how criti-\\\\ncal infrastructure can be affected by \\\\ufb02ooding, but also can be\\\\nused as validation material for future \\\\ufb02ood risk assessments.\\\\n1 Introduction\\\\nIn mid-July 2021, a persistent low-pressure system caused\\\\nextreme precipitation in parts of the Belgian, German and\\\\nDutch catchments of the Meuse and Rhine rivers. This led\\\\nto record-breaking water levels and severe \\\\ufb02ooding (Mohr\\\\net al., 2022). Comparable heavy precipitation events in this\\\\narea have never been registered in most of the affected areas\\\\nbefore (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). The German states most af-\\\\nfected include Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz), with\\\\ndamage to the Ahr River valley (Ahrtal), several regions in\\\\nthe Eiffel National Park, to the city of Trier. Flooding in\\\\nBelgium was concentrated in the Vesdre River valley (dis-\\\\ntricts of Pepinster, Ensival and Verviers), the Meuse River\\\\nvalley (Maaseik, Li\\\\u00e9ge), the Gete River valley (Herk-de-Stad\\\\nand Halen) and southeast Brussels (Wavre). The Netherlands\\\\nexperienced \\\\ufb02ooding, mostly concentrated in the southern\\\\ndistrict of Limburg. In total, at least 220 casualties have\\\\nbeen reported, with insured loss estimates of approximately\\\\nEUR 150 million\\\\u2013EUR 250 million in the Netherlands (Ver-\\\\nbond voor Verzekeraars, 2022), \\\\u223cEUR 2.2 billion in Bel-\\\\ngium (Assuralia, 2022) and \\\\u223cEUR 8.2 billion (GDV , 2022)\\\\nin Germany. The event caused major damages to residential\\\\nand commercial structures and to many critical infrastruc-\\\\nture (CI) assets. Not only vital functions for \\\\ufb01rst responders\\\\nwere affected (e.g. hospitals, \\\\ufb01re departments), but also rail-\\\\nways, bridges and utility networks (e.g. water and electricity\\\\nsupply) were severely damaged, expecting to take months to\\\\nyears to fully rebuild.\\\\nCI is often considered to be the backbone of a well-\\\\nfunctioning society (Hall et al., 2016), which is particularly\\\\neminent during natural hazards and disasters. For instance,\\\\nfailure of electricity or telecommunication services immedi-\\\\nately causes disruptions in the day-to-day functioning of peo-\\\\nple and businesses, including those outside the directly af-\\\\nfected area. Despite the (academic) agreement that failure of\\\\ninfrastructure systems may cause (large-scale) societal dis-\\\\nruptions (Garschagen and Sandholz, 2018; Hallegatte et al.,\\\\n2019; Fekete and Sandholz, 2021), empirical evidence on the\\\\nimpacts of extreme weather events on these systems is still\\\\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\\\\n\\\\n3832 E. E. Koks et al.: Flood impacts to infrastructure\\\\nlimited. This brief communication provides an overview of\\\\nthe observed \\\\ufb02ood impacts to large-scale infrastructure sys-\\\\ntems during the 2021 mid-July western European \\\\ufb02ood event\\\\nand how reconstruction of these large-scale systems has pro-\\\\ngressed. Next, we highlight how some of these observations\\\\ncompare to academic modelling approaches. We conclude\\\\nwith suggestions on moving forward in CI risk modelling,\\\\nbased on the lessons learned from this extreme event.\\\\n2 Critical infrastructure impacts\\\\n2.1 Transport infrastructure\\\\nIn Germany, road and railway infrastructure was severely\\\\ndamaged as documented exemplarily in Fig. 1. Cost esti-\\\\nmates reach up to EURO 2 billion Euro (MDR, 2021). More\\\\nthan 130 km of motorways were closed directly after the\\\\nevent, of which 50 km were still closed two months later,\\\\nwith an estimated repair cost of EUR 100 million (Hauser,\\\\n2021). Of the 112 bridges in the \\\\ufb02ooded 40 km of the Ahr\\\\nvalley (Rhineland-Palatinate), 62 bridges were destroyed,\\\\n13 were severely damaged and only 35 were in operation\\\\na month after the \\\\ufb02ood event (MDR, 2021). Over 74 km\\\\nof roads, paths and bridges in the Ahr valley have been\\\\n(critically) damaged. In some cases, repairs are expected to\\\\ntake months to years (Zeit Online, 2021). For example, ma-\\\\njor freeway sections, including parts of the A1 motorway,\\\\nwere closed until early 2022 (24Rhein, 2022). In addition,\\\\nabout 50 000 cars were damaged, causing insurance claims of\\\\nsome EUR 450 million (ADAC, 2021). The German railway\\\\nprovider Deutsche Bahn expects asset damages of around\\\\nEUR 1.3 billion. Among other things, 180 level crossings,\\\\nalmost 40 signal boxes, over 1000 catenary and signal masts,\\\\nand 600 km of tracks were destroyed, as well as energy sup-\\\\nply systems, elevators and lighting systems (MDR, 2021).\\\\nAs of 11 April 2022, 14 of the affected rail stretches are\\\\nfully functional again. The less damaged stretches were func-\\\\ntional again within 3 months, while some of the most dam-\\\\naged sections in the Ahr valley are expected to be \\\\ufb01nished\\\\nby the end of 2025 (DB, 2022). In Belgium, approximately\\\\n10 km of railway tracks and 3000 sleeper tracks have to be re-\\\\nplaced; 50 km of catenary needs to be repaired; and 70 000 t\\\\nof railway track bed needs to be placed, with estimated\\\\ncosts between EUR 30 million\\\\u2013EUR 50 million (Rozendaal,\\\\n2021a). Most damages have been repaired within 2 weeks.\\\\nThe most severely damaged railway line (between the vil-\\\\nlages of Spa and Pepinster) was reopened again on 3 Octo-\\\\nber 2021 (Rozendaal, 2021b). In the Netherlands, no large-\\\\nscale damage has been reported to transport infrastructure. A\\\\nfew national highways were partly \\\\ufb02ooded (e.g. the A76 in\\\\nboth directions) or brie\\\\ufb02y closed ( < 3 d) because of the po-\\\\ntential of \\\\ufb02ooding. Most likely due to relative low-\\\\ufb02ow ve-\\\\nlocities, damage to Dutch national road infrastructure was\\\\nlimited. Several railway sections were closed (e.g. the rail-\\\\nway section between Maastricht and Li\\\\u00e9ge) and some dam-\\\\nage occurred to the railway infrastructure, in particular to the\\\\nelectronic \\\\u201ctrack circuit\\\\u201d devices and saturated railway em-\\\\nbankments (Prorail, 2021).\\\\n2.2 Electricity and gas supply\\\\nAt the peak of the event, around 200 000 people experienced\\\\npower outages in Germany. Electricity infrastructure was\\\\nseverely damaged in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-\\\\nPalatinate. However, within 2 d around 50 % of the power\\\\nwas restored through repairs and temporary \\\\ufb01xes. Within 8\\\\nweeks, no emergency power generators were required any-\\\\nmore, with most of the power infrastructure restored in Ger-\\\\nmany\\\\u2019s affected areas. Some areas, however, only had perma-\\\\nnent power infrastructure after 6 months (Westnetz, 2022).\\\\nThe gas distribution network in the Ahr valley was severely\\\\ndamaged. Approximately 133 km of natural gas pipelines,\\\\n8500 gas metres, 3400 house pressure regulators, 7220 of the\\\\napproximately 8000 household connections, and 31 systems\\\\nmeasuring and regulating gas pressure have been damaged\\\\nor destroyed (SWR, 2021). Gas supply was almost fully re-\\\\nstored within 4.5 months after the \\\\ufb02ood event (Energienetze\\\\nMittelrhein, 2021). In Belgium, approximately 41 500 peo-\\\\nple experienced power outages at the peak of the event. This\\\\nwas the result of both damaged and deliberately switched-\\\\noff electrical cabinets to prevent serious damages. It took\\\\naround 3 weeks to fully restore power. Similar to Germany,\\\\nsevere damage had been observed to the gas network. In the\\\\nvillages around Li\\\\u00e9ge, such as Chaudfontaine and Pepinster\\\\n(Belgium), gas supply was fully recovered within 5 months\\\\n(Grosjean, 2021; De Wolf, 2021). In the Netherlands, 1000\\\\u2013\\\\n2000 households experienced a loss of electricity supply at\\\\nthe peak of the event. Between 100 to 200 households had\\\\nno gas supply. Within several days, electricity supply was re-\\\\nstored (Task Force Fact Finding Hoogwater, 2021).\\\\n2.3 Drinking water supply and wastewater\\\\nIn the region of Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), most drink-\\\\ning water supply was restored within 2 months (Hochwasser\\\\nAhr, 2021a). However, sewage treatment plants in Alte-\\\\nnahr, Mayschoss and Sinzig had been largely destroyed\\\\n(Hochwasser Ahr, 2021b), and it is expected to take at least\\\\n1.5 years to fully repair most sewage treatment plants. Emer-\\\\ngency sewage treatment plants have been built in the mean-\\\\ntime (GA, 2021). In the Erft region 7 out of 31 wastewater\\\\nfacilities had been destroyed. Many facilities reported pollu-\\\\ntion of oil and diesel, forming layers up to 15 cm thick (Kuhn,\\\\n2021). In addition, much of the groundwater (and soil) in\\\\nthe \\\\ufb02ood region was mixed with oil (from destroyed residen-\\\\ntial oil tanks), chemicals such as fertilizers (from wineries\\\\nand other agriculture) and chemicals from nearby industrial\\\\nplants. In Sinzig, 3 .6 \\\\u00d7106 L of oil\\\\u2013water mixture was re-\\\\ncycled, gaining 3600 m3 of oil, to be reused for heating and\\\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

In the heavily destroyed town\\\\nof Bad M\\\\u00fcnstereifel (in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia),\\\\ndrinking water supply was re-established within 5 d after the\\\\n\\\\ufb02ood event (most frequently through emergency tanks), and\\\\nabout 50 % of the city centre was reconnected to the fresh-\\\\nwater network shortly thereafter however, water had to be\\\\nboiled before consumption until about 1 month later (Bad\\\\nM\\\\u00fcnstereifel, 2021). In Belgium, several towns experienced\\\\ndisruptions in water supply (in particular as a result of pol-\\\\nlution). Directly after the event, approximately 3400 families\\\\nhad no access to potable water. Within less than a week, this\\\\nwas reduced to around 1650 families (Terzake, 2021). It took,\\\\nhowever, 6 months to rebuild the permanent water supply in-\\\\nfrastructure (SWDE, 2022). In the Netherlands, little to no\\\\nproblems have been recorded with regards to water supply.\\\\n2.4 Solid waste\\\\nWe found no information regarding direct impact on solid-\\\\nwaste facilities as a result of the \\\\ufb02ood event. However, there\\\\nis a large pressure on the solid-waste sector to clean the af-\\\\nfected areas; 1 month after the event, we observed dozens\\\\nof large temporary waste \\\\ufb01lls and frequent incidences of\\\\noil pollution in Rhineland-Palatinate during a \\\\ufb01eld visit.\\\\nIn the Ahrweiler district alone, the \\\\ufb02ood caused as much\\\\nsolid waste as normally would be collected over 30 years.\\\\nIn Belgium, the amount of solid waste is estimated around\\\\n160 000 t, stored at several places, such as the abandoned\\\\nhighway track A601. This highway has been used for approx-\\\\nimately 9 months as a temporary storage for debris (Cou-\\\\nplez, 2022). In the Netherlands, there have been primarily\\\\nproblems with waste deposits along the river banks, which\\\\nis mostly the solid waste transported by the river from fur-\\\\nther upstream. Thousands of tonnes of tree debris (logs and\\\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3831-2022 Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3831\\\\u20133838, 2022\\\\n\\\\n3834 E. E.

For instance, the\\\\ntowns of H\\\\u00f6enningen and Mayschoss, served as major recy-\\\\ncle hubs. Per day, approximately 500 t of wood debris was\\\\ntransported, cut, chipped and recycled into \\\\ufb01rewood, which\\\\ncontinued for at least 6 weeks after the \\\\ufb02ood (Gather, 2021).\\\\n2.5 Telecommunication\\\\nIn Germany, all severely affected areas experienced dis-\\\\nruption of mobile network services. Within the region of\\\\nRhineland-Palatinate, it took 2 weeks to ensure 100 % cover-\\\\nage again through emergency communication masts. Within\\\\n1 month, most of the network was restored to pre-disaster ser-\\\\nvice provision. After 5 months, broadband has also been re-\\\\nstored in the most affected areas, which started in most areas\\\\nonly after power infrastructure was rebuilt (Westnetz, 2021).\\\\nIn Belgium, it has taken around 11 months to restore connec-\\\\ntion to the last communities within the affected area. In the\\\\nNetherlands, approximately 7000 households were affected\\\\nby disrupted telecommunication service. This was primarily\\\\ndue to \\\\ufb02ooded telecommunication infrastructure in the direct\\\\nvicinity of \\\\ufb02ooded houses. However, some distribution cab-\\\\ninets were \\\\ufb02ooded as well, with the largest \\\\ufb02ooded cabinet\\\\naffecting around 700 households. Due to damaged bridges,\\\\nseveral \\\\ufb01bre cables were damaged. Five telecommunication\\\\nmasts were affected as well, but \\\\u201ctuning\\\\u201d of the network\\\\nensured that the service disruption was kept to a minimum\\\\n(Task Force Fact Finding Hoogwater, 2021).\\\\n2.6 Healthcare and education\\\\nIn Germany, an estimated 180 general-practitioner practices\\\\nhave been affected by the \\\\ufb02ood event. Impacts range from\\\\ncompletely destroyed to unable to operate due to a lack\\\\nof running water and electricity (\\\\u00c4rzte Zeitung, 2021). Af-\\\\nter 1.5 months, medical care was guaranteed again in the\\\\nmost affected regions in Rhineland-Palatinate (Hochwasser\\\\nAhr, 2021c). In the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, approx-\\\\nimately 68 hospitals have been affected, of which several\\\\nhave been affected severely and will take at least 1.5 years\\\\nto be rebuilt (Fig. 2). Direct damages are estimated to be\\\\nat least EUR 100 million to repair all medical facilities (Ko-\\\\nrzilius, 2021). In the town of Eschweiler (Germany), for ex-\\\\nample, the basement of the hospital was \\\\ufb02ooded, as well as\\\\nthe outbuildings and the entire outdoor area. The power sup-\\\\nply collapsed, the entire building technology was destroyed\\\\nand some 300 patients had to be evacuated by helicopter.\\\\nProperty damage is expected to be around EUR 50 million.\\\\nWithin 3.5 weeks, the hospital was partly operational, and\\\\nwithin 3 months, all hospital operations continued normally\\\\n(SAH Eschweiler, 2021). The Mutterhaus Ehrang hospital in\\\\nTrier (Germany) is now permanently closed as the hospital is\\\\ntoo severely damaged to rebuild. Furthermore, in the region\\\\nof Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), 19 daycare centres and\\\\n17 schools suffered damage from the \\\\ufb02oods, affecting more\\\\nthan 8000 students (Staib, 2021). Approximately 4 months\\\\nafter the \\\\ufb02ood event, the district of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler\\\\nestablished emergency educational facilities using 297 con-\\\\ntainers that serve as classrooms, of\\\\ufb01ces and dining facilities\\\\nfor more than 800 students (Wiesbadener Kurier, 2021). In\\\\nBelgium, various rural clinics have been affected and were\\\\nunable to provide any services. Concurrently, in the most af-\\\\nfected areas, general-practitioner facilities have been com-\\\\npletely destroyed (Le Sp\\\\u00e9cialiste, 2021). In the Netherlands,\\\\none nursing home was \\\\ufb02ooded, and one hospital was evacu-\\\\nated as a precautionary measure.\\\\n3 Have research studies already \\\\u201cre\\\\ufb02ected\\\\u201d such\\\\nimpacts?\\\\nMost often, large-scale object-based infrastructure impact\\\\nstudies (e.g. Bubeck et al., 2019) only disclose aggregated\\\\nrisk metrics (i.e. country-level risk estimates), which ham-\\\\npers veri\\\\ufb01cation and validation with observed impacts on\\\\nsmaller scales. Van Ginkel et al. (2021) assessed river \\\\ufb02ood\\\\nrisk for all road segments in Europe. Of the eight motorway\\\\n\\\\ufb02oods incidents in Germany reported by Hauser (2021), three\\\\nare recognizable as \\\\ufb02ood hotspots in van Ginkel et al. (2021).\\\\nDuring the event in 2021, most damage was caused by rel-\\\\natively small rivers which are only represented in the haz-\\\\nard data from the point that the upstream catchment is above\\\\n500 km2. For example, the Ahr valley is partly covered (400\\\\nof the 900 km2) by van Ginkel et al., 2021, who estimate the\\\\nroad repair costs at EUR 4 million to EUR 29 million (under\\\\nlow- and high-\\\\ufb02ow velocities respectively.) for a 1:500 year\\\\nevent. The \\\\ufb01eld visit showed damage caused by high-\\\\ufb02ow\\\\nvelocities at multiple places, and video footage of the events\\\\nsuggests these are locally more towards 2 m s \\\\u22121, which van\\\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3831\\\\u20133838, 2022 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3831-2022\\\\n\\\\nE. E. Koks et al.: Flood impacts to infrastructure 3835\\\\nGinkel et al. (2021) considered \\\\u201chigh-\\\\ufb02ow velocity\\\\u201d, than\\\\ntowards 0.2 m s\\\\u22121, which they considered \\\\u201clow-\\\\ufb02ow veloc-\\\\nity\\\\u201d. At \\\\ufb01rst sight, the spatial extent of the exposed assets\\\\nhas reasonable correspondence to the model of van Ginkel\\\\net al. (2021). However, the model ignores bridge damage,\\\\nwhich in reality was a major source of damage (Sect. 2.1).\\\\nAlso, a signi\\\\ufb01cant share of observed damage resulted from\\\\npluvial \\\\ufb02ooding, \\\\ufb02ash \\\\ufb02ooding and landslides which was not\\\\ncaptured by van Ginkel et al. (2021).\\\\nReconnaissance observations (August 2021) along the\\\\nrivers Ahr and Erft (Lemnitzer et al., 2022) documented se-\\\\nvere, as well as irreparable, damage to bridges designed and\\\\nconstructed within the last 2 decades and total destruction of\\\\nalmost all historical bridges, typically constructed on shallow\\\\nfoundations. Historical bridge designs concentrated primar-\\\\nily on cross-sectional requirements for expected water vol-\\\\numes. Triggered by \\\\ufb02ood events in the past four decades,\\\\nbridge design research has broadened by focusing on risk-\\\\nbased scour assessment, hydrodynamic pier designs, reduc-\\\\ntion of intermediate bridge support elements, impact and col-\\\\nlision loading, implementation of bridge protection mecha-\\\\nnisms such as from wood debris, and machine learning ap-\\\\nproaches from past failures (V AW 188, 2006; Bento et al.,\\\\n2020; Majtan et al., 2021; Naser, 2021). Accounting for all\\\\nthese mechanisms, however, is complex (Haehnel and Daly,\\\\n2004) and no guarantee to avoid the observed failures. Var-\\\\nious international design codes (e.g. American bridge stan-\\\\ndard AASHTO, Australian bridge standard AS5100, and\\\\nJapanese bridge standard SHB) provide quantitative tools to\\\\nassess impact loading from debris/tree logs; however, bridges\\\\nerected prior to recent design requirements are unable to\\\\nmaintain global structural stability under the excessive mul-\\\\ntidirectional loading, such as seen in the 2021 \\\\ufb02oods. Based\\\\non \\\\ufb01eld observations, the advancement of erosion prevention\\\\npractices for \\\\ufb02ood events emerged as a critical research fo-\\\\ncus, as the interface stability between water, soil and foun-\\\\ndation elements was found to be compromised at almost all\\\\nbridge damage locations visited.\\\\nNext to the above insights into modelling direct physical\\\\ndamages, we can also use the observation from the event\\\\nto further improve and validate our assumptions on post-\\\\ndisaster (infrastructure) recovery. In particular, when mod-\\\\nelling the economic and societal impacts, the recovery pro-\\\\ncess is one of the most important drivers of losses (e.g. Koks\\\\net al., 2015). The July 2021 event has given us several in-\\\\nsights. Firstly, there is a prioritization between different in-\\\\nfrastructure systems. In Germany, for example, we found that\\\\nin several affected areas the electricity network was repaired\\\\n\\\\ufb01rst, which was subsequently followed by the gas and broad-\\\\nband network. Secondly, there is a prioritization within in-\\\\nfrastructure systems. For example, more critical roads are re-\\\\npaired sooner than less critical roads. While this may sound\\\\nobvious, academic studies often consider a recovery of the\\\\nentire system, without considering a speci\\\\ufb01c order of im-\\\\nportance. Finally, good recovery management practices and\\\\nenough trades(wo)men (e.g. electricians, utility workers) are\\\\none of the most important drivers of a speedy and successful\\\\nrecovery. These are often not included within the modelling\\\\nassumptions.\\\\n4 Moving forward\\\\nBased on our \\\\ufb01ndings, we highlight three aspects to move\\\\nforward in the \\\\ufb01eld of infrastructure disaster risk assess-\\\\nments. First, merely focusing on \\\\ufb02ood extent and depth is\\\\nnot suf\\\\ufb01cient to estimate the impacts of extreme \\\\ufb02ood events\\\\nto infrastructure. In particular, in Germany and Belgium, it\\\\nbecame evident that the high discharge and stream\\\\ufb02ow and\\\\ncorresponding high-\\\\ufb02ow velocities (resulting from the lo-\\\\ncal topography and the intensity of the rainfall) are a de-\\\\ncisive factor in explaining the degree of destruction. Many\\\\nof the observed failures such as bridge scour, road embank-\\\\nment instabilities and erosion of aggregate foundations could\\\\nlikely better be explained from \\\\ufb02ow velocity rather than \\\\ufb02ood\\\\ndepth. Future \\\\ufb02ood impact studies, especially those focusing\\\\non transport infrastructure, should aim to account for \\\\ufb02ow\\\\nvelocity in their impact modelling, in particular in areas with\\\\nsteep gradients.\\\\nSecond, the observed impacts on CI highlight the in\\\\ufb02u-\\\\nence of spatial scale on the magnitude of the impacts. On a\\\\nlocal and regional level, the disruptions in daily lives and to\\\\nthe economy were enormous. Yet, zoomed out on a national\\\\nscale, the impacts were relatively small. While large-scale\\\\nstudies are useful to identify potential hotspots and bottle-\\\\nnecks in the system, local-scale studies are essential to better\\\\nunderstand the real impacts (and are also better able to do so).\\\\nThis is true for both the consequences to infrastructure assets\\\\nand the services and the impacts on lives and livelihoods.\\\\nFinally, the level of destruction and disruption caused by\\\\nthis event highlights the need for the development of both\\\\nasset and system-level adaptation measures, securing more\\\\nresilient infrastructure systems. Extreme weather events are\\\\nexpected to become more likely not only in western Europe,\\\\nbut also globally in an increasingly warmer world. As such,\\\\nthere is an urgency to investigate not only how service provi-\\\\nsion can be ensured in the case of an extreme event but also\\\\nhow the recovery process to a minimum service level can\\\\nbe as swift and smooth as possible. This calls for a further\\\\ncollaboration between the different sectors of reliability and\\\\nsystems engineering and disaster risk modelling and manage-\\\\nment. The limited number of studies on impact on CI due to\\\\n\\\\ufb02ooding highlights the need for more detailed infrastructure\\\\nfailure impact assessments including cascading impacts.\\\\nData availability.

       "  'Es ist einer dieser trüben Sommertage, von denen\\nes in diesem Jahr so viele gab. Vor dem\\nHaupteingang des Marien-Hospitals in\\nErftstadt-Liblar türmt sich der Schutt. Das\\nKrankenhaus ist geschlossen, seit am Morgen des 15.\\nJuli eine meterhohe Flutwelle des ansonsten harmlosen\\nFlüsschens Erft den ebenerdigen Komplex verwüstet\\nhat. Nur wenige Schritte sind es von dort zum\\nangrenzenden Ärztehaus. Hier hat die radiologische\\nPraxis von Barbara Feldgen und Matthias Wolff dasselbe\\nSchicksal erlitten. Jetzt, Ende August, sind der\\nSchlamm, die zerstörten Möbel und medizinischen\\nGeräte entsorgt. Das Erdgeschoss, in dem sich die\\nPraxis\\nbefand, ist entkernt und wartet auf den Wiederaufbau.\\n„Putz, Estrich, es ist alles raus“, sagt Wolff.\\nZwei MRT-Geräte, der Computertomograf, Röntgenanlage,\\nEDV-Technik – Totalschaden. Wichtig ist dem\\nRadiologen, dass die meisten Patientendaten gerettet\\nwerden konnten. Denn der Bildspeicher der Praxis war\\nunter der Decke angebracht.\\n„Mithilfe unseres IT-Spezialisten\\nkonnten wir das meiste rekonstruieren“, sagt\\nWolffs Praxispartnerin Feldgen. „Aber alles aus Papier,\\nwie zum Beispiel Überweisungsscheine, ist weg.“\\nDie beiden stehen zwischen schlammverschmierten\\nStyroporplatten, Schubkarren, Schuttsäcken und Stützpfeilern,\\ndort, wo vor Kurzem noch ein MRT-Gerät stand.\\n„Wir haben hier am Tag der Flut noch bis kurz vor zehn\\nUhr weitgehend normal gearbeitet“, sagt Wolff. „Es gab\\nzwar im Umkreis schon kein Telefon und keinen Strom\\nmehr. Das Ärztehaus hat aber eine eigene Stromversorgung\\nund der Trafo stand noch im Trockenen.“ Die\\nFeuerwehr war an diesem Vormittag bereits früh auf\\ndem Gelände, um den unter Wasser stehenden Keller\\ndes Marien-Hospitals auszupumpen. „Irgendwann hieß\\nes, wir sollten die Autos wegfahren, das Wasser könnte\\nsteigen“, erinnert sich Feldgen. Das ist der Zeitpunkt,\\nan dem die beiden Radiologen Patienten und Mitarbeiterinnen\\nnach Hause schicken. Feldgen sucht für ihr\\nAuto einen sicheren Parkplatz in der Umgebung. „Auf\\ndem Rückweg in die Praxis musste ich die Schuhe ausziehen,\\nweil das Wasser schon so hoch stand. Aber ich\\nmuss zugeben, ich habe die Situation unterschätzt.“\\nAuch Rettungswagen werden überflutet\\nDann kommt die Flut. Innerhalb von Minuten werden\\ndie Erdgeschosse in Klinik und Praxis überschwemmt,\\nein Feuerwehrauto und mehrere Rettungswagen,\\nmit denen Patienten aus dem Krankenhaus\\nevakuiert werden sollen, laufen voll mit schlammigem\\nWasser. Feldgen flüchtet sich mit mehreren Kolleginnen\\nund Kollegen aus dem Krankenhaus und einigen\\nPatienten in die kleine Kapelle – sie liegt fünf Stufen\\nhöher als der Rest des Geländes. Doch auch dort dringt\\nWasser ein. Über eine Wendeltreppe retten sich alle in\\nden ersten Stock des Nachbargebäudes, wo sie von den\\ndort lebenden Ordensfrauen betreut werden, bis Rettungskräfte\\nmit schweren Lastwagen die vom Wasser\\nEingeschlossenen bergen können.\\nNach der Flut\\nAnhaltender Starkregen führte Mitte Juli dazu,\\ndass sich in Nordrhein-Westfalen und Rheinland-Pfalz\\nkleine Flüsse in reißende Ströme verwandelten.\\nMeterhohe Flutwellen verwüsteten Dörfer, Städte\\nund ganze Landstiche. Allein in Nordrhein sind\\n145 Arztpraxen und im ganzen Land 68 Krankenhäuser\\nunterschiedlich schwer vom Hochwasser betroffen.\\nDie Schäden dürften nach ersten Schätzungen des\\nNRW-Gesundheitsministeriums mehr als 100 Millionen\\nEuro betragen.\\nvon Heike Korzilius\\nFoto: Till Erdmenger\\nThema\\nRheinisches Ärzteblatt / Heft 10 / 2021 13\\nDie Hilfsbereitschaft ist überwältigend\\nMan merkt Wolff und Feldgen an, dass die Ereignisse\\nvom 15. Juli ihre Spuren hinterlassen haben, nicht\\nnur in der Praxis. Dennoch strahlen beide Tatkraft und\\nZuversicht aus. Denn für die Radiologen steht fest, dass\\nsie ihre Arbeit so schnell wie möglich wieder aufnehmen\\nwollen. 3.500 Patientinnen und Patienten versorgen\\nsie und ihr Team normalerweise im Quartal, darunter\\nauch zum Teil Patienten aus dem Krankenhaus,\\ndas zwar über eine eigene radiologische Abteilung\\nverfügt, aber keine Fachärzte für Radiologie beschäftigt.\\nFeldgen gelingt es in den Tagen nach der Katastrophe,\\nin unzähligen Telefonaten\\nund über persönliche Kontakte,\\nein mobiles MRT-Gerät, einen mobilen Computertomografen\\nsowie zwei weitere Container jeweils für\\ndie Anmeldung und einen Wartebereich für die Patienten\\nzu organisieren. Aufgestellt sind die mobilen\\nEinheiten jetzt auf dem Parkplatz des Marien-Hospitals.\\nZusätzliche Untersuchungskapazitäten\\ngibt es in den\\nAbendstunden in der Partnerpraxis im knapp 20 Kilometer\\nentfernten Frechen. Dennoch können Wolff und\\nFeldgen unter diesen Umständen deutlich weniger\\nPatienten untersuchen als zuvor – was für die Praxisinhaber\\nauch Honorareinbußen\\nzur Folge hat. Die\\nbeiden\\nrechnen damit, dass sie Ende des Jahres ihre\\nPraxisräume wieder benutzen können. „Derweil arbeiten\\nwir hier wie auf dem Campingplatz“, meint Wolff\\nund lacht. „Wir sind viel draußen und müssen zum Teil\\nauch Patientengespräche in einem stillen Eckchen\\nunter\\nfreiem Himmel führen.“\\nAuf finanzielle Nothilfen ist die Praxis nicht angewiesen.\\nDie Schäden seien zum großen Teil von der Versicherung\\ngedeckt, sagt Wolff. Beeindruckt ist das Team\\nvon der überwältigenden\\nHilfsbereitschaft, die ihnen\\nin den Tagen nach der Katastrophe entgegengebracht\\nwurde\\n– nicht nur von Familie und Freunden, sondern\\nauch von Nachbarn und Dorfbewohnern. So sei es gelungen,\\nam Sonntag nach der Flut die Praxis gänzlich\\nvon Schutt und Schlamm zu befreien. „Bauern aus der\\nUmgebung haben ungefragt mit schwerem Gerät den\\nganzen Schutt abtransportiert. Ohne die hätten wir das\\ngar nicht geschafft“, sagt Dr. Markus Le Blanc. Er ist\\nRadiologe in der Partnerpraxis in Frechen und sozusagen\\nder gute Geist beim Aufbau der Mobileinheit in\\nErftstadt. Erst heute hat er Praxisschilder besorgt, die\\ndie handgeschriebenen Wegweiser ersetzen. Er schätzt\\nan dem Praxisstandort die gute Erreichbarkeit und die\\nAnbindung an das Marien-Hospital.\\n„Aber auch die\\nKardiologen und die Urologen hier im Ärztehaus und\\ndie Kolleginnen und Kollegen aus der Umgebung sind\\nausgesprochen froh darüber, dass wir unsere Notversorgung\\naufgenommen haben. Es erspart den Patienten\\nlange Wege“, sagt Le Blanc.\\nObwohl manches provisorisch ist und die Räumlichkeiten\\nbeengt sind, sind die Radiologen froh, wieder\\narbeiten zu können. „Natürlich hat man ein gewisses\\nTrauma davongetragen“, räumt Feldgen ein. „Aber\\nes geht weiter.“ Das gesamte Praxisteam habe mit\\nangepackt\\nund gesagt: „Wir bauen wieder auf, wir schaffen\\ndas.“ Es sei ihr wichtig, auch das weiterzugeben.\\nDie Praxis der Radiologen in Erftstadt ist eine von\\n145 Arztpraxen, die vom Hochwasser beschädigt wurden\\n– manche schwer, andere weniger schwer. Wie das\\nnordrhein-westfälische Gesundheitsministerium auf\\nAnfrage mitteilt, sind neben dem Rhein-Erft-Kreis auch\\ndie Region Aachen, der Kreis Euskirchen und der\\nRhein-Sieg-Kreis besonders stark betroffen. Zur Höhe\\nder entstandenen Schäden an den betroffenen Arztpraxen\\nkönne man allerdings zurzeit noch keine genauen\\nAngaben machen, erklärt das Ministerium. Man\\ngehe aktuell von einem „in jedem Fall zweistelligen\\nMillionenbetrag“ aus.\\nDrei Kliniken sind besonders betroffen\\nRelativ exakt bemessen lassen sich die Schäden, die\\ndie Flut an den drei besonders betroffenen Krankenhäusern\\nin Nordrhein angerichtet hat. Im St. Antonius\\nHospital in Eschweiler wird der Sachschaden laut\\nMinisterium\\nauf knapp 49 Millionen Euro geschätzt.\\nDort hat man inzwischen die ambulanten Behandlungen\\nzum Beispiel in der Dialyse, der Endoskopie oder\\nim Brust-Zentrum wieder aufgenommen. Bei Redaktionsschluss\\nMitte September war noch nicht klar, ob\\ndas Krankenhaus wie erhofft im Oktober auch die\\nstationäre\\nVersorgung wieder aufnehmen kann.\\nFür das Klinikum Leverkusen liegen nach Angaben\\ndes Ministeriums noch keine detaillierten Schätzungen\\nder Schadenssumme vor. Vorläufig gehe man dort von\\neinem Sachschaden in Höhe von knapp 26 Millionen\\nEuro aus. Das Krankenhaus konnte schon gut zwei\\nWochen nach der Flutkatastrophe große Teile des Betriebs\\nwieder aufnehmen.\\nNach wie vor geschlossen ist dagegen das Marien-Hospital\\nin Erftstadt.

Durch\\nden Wiederaufbaufonds des Bundes werden wir wohl\\n80 Prozent des bleibenden Schadens erstattet bekommen“,\\nerklärt Rips. „Außerdem haben wir eine eigene\\nSpendenaktion ins Leben gerufen, die inzwischen eine\\nknappe halbe Million Euro eingebracht hat.“ Darunter\\nseien viele Kleinspenden aus der Bevölkerung, die\\nderen\\nVerbundenheit mit dem Krankenhaus zeige. „Das\\nist eine tolle Solidarität“, sagt Rips, der von 2009 bis\\n2012 Bürgermeister in Erftstadt war.\\nRund 65 Millionen Euro an Soforthilfe sind nach\\nAngaben des NRW-Heimatministeriums bis Anfang\\nSeptember an die Kommunen geflossen. Was davon\\nim Einzelnen Krankenhäusern und Praxen zugutegekommen\\nsei, darüber lägen zurzeit keine Informationen\\nvor, heißt es dort. Der Gesamtverband der Deutschen\\nVersicherungswirtschaft (GDV) rechnet durch\\ndie Flutkatastrophe\\nin sämtlichen betroffenen Regionen\\nmit Versicherungsschäden von rund sieben\\nMilliarden\\nEuro. Dabei lägen die tatsächlichen Unwetterschäden\\nnoch weit über den aktuellen Schätzungen,\\nda nicht alle Gebäude gegen alle Naturgefahren versichert\\nseien, heißt es dort.

Die Flut im Juli sei ein Jahrhundertereignis\\ngewesen, das sich allerdings angesichts\\nder veränderten Klimasituation jetzt schneller\\nwiederholen könnte, meint der Jurist. „Grundsätzlich\\nist der Hochwasserschutz aber eine politische Aufgabe.“\\nEr erwarte von der Politik, dass diese ein schlüssiges\\nGesamtkonzept erstelle und dazu gehöre auch\\nder bessere Schutz von Altenheim, Krankenhaus und\\nHospiz.\\nDie momentane Schließung des Marien-Hospitals\\nbedeutet nach Ansicht von Rips einen erheblichen\\nEinschnitt für die Patientinnen und Patienten. „Unser\\nEinzugsbereich umfasst ungefähr 100.000 Menschen.\\nErftstadt und die angrenzenden Gemeinden sind auf\\nuns orientiert“, betont er. Auch der aktuelle Krankenhausplan\\ndes Landes NRW verzeichne das Haus, in\\ndem jährlich gut 7.000 Patienten behandelt werden\\nund das seit fünf Jahren schwarze Zahlen schreibt, als\\ndie Erft dort angerichtet hat. „Wir hoffen, dass im\\nOktober\\ndie Notfallambulanz wieder in Betrieb ist. Das\\nist die erste Priorität“, sagt der Vorstand der Stiftung\\nMarien-Hospital Erftstadt-Frauenthal, Dr. jur. Franz-Georg\\nRips, dem Rheinischen Ärzteblatt. Mit der\\nWiederaufnahme\\ndes regulären Krankenhausbetriebs\\nrechne er frühestens in einem Jahr. Den Gesamtschaden,\\nden die Flut auf dem Gelände angerichtet\\nhat, beziffert Rips zurzeit mit etwa 21 bis 22 Millionen\\nEuro. „Es ist eigentlich alles kaputt“, stellt er fest. Im\\nGebäude müssen sämtliche Böden und Türen, Wasserversorgung,\\nHeizungsanlage und Elektroinstallationen\\nerneuert werden. Auch die medizinischen\\nGeräte\\nseien unbrauchbar: die Röntgenanlage, das CT,\\ndas Linksherzkathetergerät, Beatmungs- und Narkosegeräte,\\nUltraschall- und Echokardiografiegeräte, Infusionspumpen,\\nOP-Tische, 130 Betten, sieben Intensivbetten\\n– alles sei zerstört.

Und wir haben beschlossen,\\nalle 500 Arbeitsplätze zu erhalten“, betont Rips. Zurzeit\\nwürden die Gehälter über Kurzarbeitergeld finanziert\\nund zunächst bis Ende des Jahres aus Stiftungsmitteln\\nauf ein volles Grundgehalt aufgestockt. „Ob wir das\\ndanach wirtschaftlich noch schaffen, dazu kann ich\\njetzt noch keine endgültige Aussage treffen“, meint der\\nStiftungsvorstand.

The\\naim of this study is to analyze and assess the flood within\\nan interdisciplinary approach along its entire process chain:\\nthe synoptic setting of the atmospheric pressure fields, the\\nprocesses causing the high rainfall totals, the extraordinary\\nstreamflows and water levels in the affected catchments, the\\nhydro-morphological effects, and the impacts on infrastructure\\nand society. In addition, we address the question of what\\nmeasures are possible to generate added value to early response\\nmanagement in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.\\nThe superposition of several factors resulted in widespread\\nextreme precipitation totals and water levels well beyond a\\n100-year event: slow propagation of the low pressure system\\nBernd, convection embedded in a mesoscale precipitation\\nfield, unusually moist air masses associated with a significant\\npositive anomaly in sea surface temperature over the\\nBaltic Sea, wet soils, and steep terrain in the affected catchments.\\nVarious hydro-morphodynamic processes as well as\\nchanges in valley morphology observed during the event exacerbated\\nthe impact of the flood. Relevant effects included,\\namong many others, the occurrence of extreme landscape\\nerosion, rapidly evolving erosion and scour processes in the\\nchannel network and urban space, recruitment of debris from\\nthe natural and urban landscape, and deposition and clogging\\nof bottlenecks in the channel network with eventual collapse.\\nThe estimation of inundation areas as well as the derived\\ndamage assessments were carried out during or directly after\\nthe flood and show the potential of near-real-time forensic\\ndisaster analyses for crisis management, emergency personnel\\non-site, and the provision of relief supplies.

Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1\\n1 Introduction\\nThe severe flood event in western Germany and neighboring\\ncountries in mid-July 2021 was one of the most severe\\ncatastrophes in Europe in the last half century. Precipitation\\ntotals of up to 150mm over an extensive area falling within\\n15 to 18 h led to the severe flooding particularly on 14 and\\n15 July 2021. The flood claimed many lives, with at least\\n180 fatalities in Germany alone. The two German federal\\nstates of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Rhineland-\\nPalatinate (RP) were particularly affected, but also the neighboring\\ncountries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\\nIn Germany, the flood had a devastating effect in the\\nnortheast of the low mountain range Eifel, where villages\\nalong the rivers Ahr and Erft, both left tributaries of the\\nRhine, were affected (Fig. 1). Severe damage was caused\\nto buildings, household goods, industry, but also to infrastructure\\nsuch as railways, roads, and bridges. According to\\nMunich Re (2022), total losses amount to EUR 46 billion,\\nEUR 33 billion of which was in Germany alone, making this\\nevent the most expensive catastrophe in Germany to date.\\nThe insured portion was relatively low at EUR 8.2 billion in\\nGermany (all countries EUR 11 billion; Munich Re, 2022)\\nbecause of a low insurance density of residential buildings\\n(only about 37% to 47% are insured) and infrastructure\\ndamage in that region.\\nThe Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction\\nTechnology (CEDIM, https://www.cedim.kit.edu/, last\\naccess: 13 November 2022), an interdisciplinary research\\ncenter in the field of disasters, risks, and security at Karlsruhe\\nInstitute of Technology (KIT), Germany, has been\\nconducting forensic disaster analyses (FDAs) in near-realtime\\nsince 2011 (e.g., Kunz et al., 2013; Merz et al., 2014;\\nPiper et al., 2016; Wilhelm et al., 2021). The approach of\\nforensically investigating disasters stems from the interdisciplinary\\nresearch program integrated research on disaster\\nrisk (IRDR) and their program forensic investigation of disasters\\n(FORIN; Burton, 2010). IRDR uses the forensic approach\\nto uncover the root causes of disasters through indepth\\ninvestigations and to build an understanding of how\\nhazards do or do not become disasters. CEDIM aims for a\\ntimely analysis within a few hours to a few days after the\\nevent. CEDIM’s FDAs examine the dynamics and interrelations\\nof disasters, identifies major risk drivers, estimates the\\nimpact (damage, fatalities, displaced people), and infers possible\\nimplications for disaster mitigation – as was the case in\\nJuly 2021 on the extraordinary flood event, for which the report\\nwith first damage estimates was issued only 1 week after\\nthe event (Schäfer et al., 2021). This FDA report summarizing\\nfindings from different disciplines, but also more detailed\\nanalyses performed in the months after the flood, for example,\\nconcerning the relation to climate change, motivated us\\nfor this two-part paper.\\nEfficient and effective emergency management is essential\\nto reduce the adverse effects from disasters, particularly\\nin the case of sudden-onset natural hazards (Ye et al., 2020).\\nA prerequisite for disaster response is to get as reliable and\\ntimely an overview as possible of the severity and extent of\\nan event to identify most vulnerable facilities and areas, to\\nprioritize emergency measures, or to organize evacuations if\\nnecessary (Merz et al., 2020). New opportunities for disaster\\nresponse arise on the one hand from technological advances\\nin recent years, such as surveillance by drones, information\\napps for smartphones, or crowd-sourcing of information via\\nsocial networks, and on the other hand from better understanding\\nof human behavior in the emergency phase and the\\nsocietal context (Kreibich et al., 2017; Aerts et al., 2018).\\nHowever, these are often not adequately taken into account\\nand implemented in practice and decision-making processes\\n– also showcased by the 2021 flood.\\nTo better assess, predict, and manage catastrophes such\\nas the July 2021 flood, close collaboration and interactions\\namong scientists and practitioners across discipline boundaries\\nare absolutely vital. A multi-disciplinary framework\\nsuch as FDAs enables assessing the complex interactions\\nof processes across different compartments from meteorology\\n(e.g., weather situation, precipitation) to hydrological\\nconditions (e.g., river basins, flow characteristics) to hydromorphological\\nimpacts (e.g., changes in valleys morphology,\\nerosion, and deposition areas) to impacts on assets and environment.\\nThe objective of this two-part study is a multidisciplinary\\nassessment of the entire process chain of the\\nJuly 2021 flood in central Europe – from causes to impacts\\nto historical classification and climatological context.We address\\nthe following main research questions: (1) what were\\nthe hydro-meteorological causes of the July 2021 flood, and\\nwhat interactions and impacts were observed? What made\\nthe flood so exceptional? (2) What additional information can\\nbe generated directly in the aftermath of an extreme flood\\nevent to support disaster management and how reliable are\\nfirst estimates? While Part 1 focuses on the description of the\\nevent across various disciplines (meteorological, hydrological,\\nhydro-morphological, economic) and addresses the aspect\\nregarding early response, the second part (Ludwig et al.,\\n2022, henceforth referred to as PART2) puts the event in both\\nhistorical and anthropogenic climate change contexts.\\nThe paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the\\ndifferent data sets and methods used. Section 3 discusses\\nthe prevailing meteorological and hydrological particularities\\nand characteristics before and during the July 2021 flood,\\nfollowed by a discussion of the hydro-morphodynamic processes\\nin relation to the flood. Section 4 addresses the impacts\\nand consequences with a focus on near-real-time estimation\\nof inundation areas, damage assessment, and rail\\nand road infrastructure failure. Finally, Sect. 6 discusses and\\nsummarizes the main results, draws conclusions, and provides\\nan outlook on Part 2.\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Overview map of the most affected region within the European context (inset at small bottom right), with the main rivers (blue),\\nriver gauges (red), and reservoirs (brown) addressed in the paper, including the catchments of the rivers Ahr and Erft (hatched gray). In\\naddition, the low mountain range Eifel, the Ardennes (both part of the Rhenish Slate Mountains), the low terrace plain Cologne Bay (gray\\ncapital letters), and the border between the two federal states North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Rhineland-Palatinate (RP) are labeled\\n(dark blue).\\n2 Data and methods\\nThe region most affected in July 2021 by the heavy rainfall\\nand subsequent flooding, and thus our region of main interest,\\nis a low mountain range named Eifel with steep, deeply\\ncarved valleys. It is located in western Germany (mainly in\\nthe federal state of RP), eastern Luxembourg, and southeastern\\nBelgium (see Fig. 1). In the west, the Eifel is limited by\\nthe river Meuse, in the south by the river Moselle, and in\\nthe east by the river Rhine. To the west, the Eifel is continued\\nby the low mountain region of the Ardennes in Belgium\\nand to the north by the lowland region of the Cologne Bay\\nin Germany. In total, the region covers roughly 20 000 km2\\n(150\\x02130 km), which is unusually large for the registered\\nhigh precipitation intensities and totals (see Sect. 3.1) and a\\nkey characteristic of this event.\\n2.1 Analysis and weather forecast data\\nGeopotential pattern, precipitable water, and sea surface temperature\\n(SST) from the European Centre for Medium-Range\\nWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach\\net al., 2020) interpolated to a 0.5\\x0e grid were used for\\nanalyses during the flood event and for climatological assessment\\n(anomalies). In addition, based on these data, the\\npathway of air masses that reached the affected region was\\ninvestigated with 10 d kinematic backward trajectories using\\nthe Lagrangian analysis tool (LAGRANTO; Sprenger\\nand Wernli, 2015). The trajectories are based on the threedimensional\\n(3D) wind field (u, v, !) on all model levels at a\\nhorizontal grid spacing of 0:5\\x0e\\x020:5\\x0e and temporal resolution\\nof 3 h. The backward trajectories were initialized every 6 h\\nbetween 14 July 06:00UTC and 15 July 06:00UTC at four\\ngrid points (51.0, 50.5, 50.0, 51.0\\x0e N; 7.0, 7.0, 6.5, 6.5\\x0e E;\\nsee Fig. 1). Following Sodemann et al. (2008), we started the\\ntrajectories vertically every 30 hPa between 970 and 590 hPa\\nand considered only those which exhibit a relative humidity\\ngreater than 80% at their initial time.\\nThe predictability of the event is assessed by operational\\nforecasts with the ICON model from the German Meteorological\\nService (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) for different\\nhorizontal resolutions and lead times. The ICON model\\nwas introduced into DWD’s operational forecast system in\\nJanuary 2015 (Zängl et al., 2015). In this study, we used\\nthe regional refinements of the global ICON forecast over\\nEurope (ICON-EU, 7 km horizontal grid spacing) and Germany\\n(ICON-D2, 2.2 km grid spacing) as well as output\\nfrom the ICON-D2 ensemble prediction systems (ICON-D2-\\nEPS). The considered ICON-EU simulations are initialized\\nat 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC and provide forecasts\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023 Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n528 S. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1\\nfor the next 120 h. The higher resolved ICON-D2 simulations\\nare initialized every 3 h (00:00, 03:00 UTC, etc.) and\\nprovide 27 h forecasts. In addition, the DWD produces ensemble\\nforecasts with the ICON-D2-EPS based on 20 ensemble\\nmembers (Reinert et al., 2020) for the same initial\\ntimes and domain as ICON-D2.\\nAdditionally, the extreme forecast index (EFI) for precipitation\\nbased on the ensemble prediction systems (EPS) of\\nECMWF was considered to assess the possibility of the occurrence\\nof extreme weather. The EFI indicates whether the\\nECMWF-EPS forecast distribution is substantially different\\nfrom the model climate (more details about EFI see, e.g.,\\nLalaurette, 2003; Zsoter et al., 2015). An EFI of 0.5 to 0.8\\nindicates an unusual event, and EFI values above 0.8 indicate\\na very unusual or extreme event.\\n2.2 Precipitation data\\nTo quantify precipitation amounts during the flood event,\\nhourly and daily precipitation totals at single ground-based\\nobservational stations were taken from the network operated\\nby DWD comprising about 2000 stations in Germany. The\\ntemporal resolution of the precipitation measurements is usually\\n1 h, but can reach up to 1 min. Unless otherwise noted,\\ndaily precipitation readings cover the period from 05:50 to\\n05:50 UTC to match with other data sets used in this study.\\nIn addition, different gridded precipitation data sets provided\\nby DWD were used in this study for both the\\nevent analysis and the estimation of return periods, including\\ndaily HYRAS data (Hydrometeorologische Rasterdatensätze;\\nRauthe et al., 2013) and hourly RADOLAN\\ndata (Radar-Online-Aneichung;Weigl andWinterrath, 2009;\\nWinterrath et al., 2018). HYRAS is a gridded data set covering\\nGermany and its relevant river basins in neighboring\\ncountries at a 5\\x025 km2 grid resolution currently available\\nfor the period from 1951 to 2015 (update in preparation).\\nIt is based on several thousand climate stations interpolated\\nto the regular grid considering elevation, exposition, and\\nclimatology. A sub-sample of HYRAS is the HYRAS-DE\\ndata, formerly known as REGNIE (Regionalisierte Niederschlagshöhen),\\ncovering only Germany but with a higher resolution\\nof 1 km2. HYRAS-DE is continuously updated on a\\ndaily basis and thus available for the July 2021 event. Caldas-\\nAlvarez et al. (2022) found that HYRAS-DE reflects well the\\nabsolute frequency of precipitation observations and is well\\nsuited for process-based and statistical analyses of extreme\\nprecipitation.\\nRADOLAN is a radar-based near-real-time precipitation\\ndata set covering Germany and parts of the neighboring\\ncountries, with a horizontal resolution of roughly 1 km2\\nand an hourly temporal resolution and has been available\\nsince 2001. Measured reflectivities Z of the 17 radar sites operated\\nby DWDare converted into precipitation rates R using\\nseasonal differentiated empirical Z–R relations. To account\\nfor uncertainties in this conversion as well as for typical radar\\nartifacts, the radar-based precipitation rates are calibrated using\\nhourly data of over 1000 ground-based observational stations\\nby applying different weighting and comparative techniques.\\nAntecedent wetness conditions in a river basin can be a\\ndecisive factor whether a rainfall event becomes a flood or\\nnot. Therefore, we used the established antecedent precipitation\\nindex (API; Kohler and Linsley, 1951; Viessman et al.,\\n2002), which was applied to the RADOLAN data aggregated\\nto a daily temporal resolution, to describe the conditions prior\\nto the event. The suitability of API as a soil moisture proxy\\nwas shown, for example, by Blanchard et al. (1981) or Teng\\net al. (1993). API is based on a weighted precipitation accumulation\\nover several days, typically 7 to 14 d (Heggen,\\n2001). In line with Schröter et al. (2015), we used a precondition\\nperiod of 30 d in this study. The weighting factor k was\\nset to k D 0:9 as suggested by Heggen (2001) or Schröter\\net al. (2015).\\n2.3 River gauge data\\nAll water level W and streamflow Q data from gauges used\\nin this study were provided by the water administrations of\\nRhineland-Palatinate, the Erftverband, and the Wupperverband.\\nFrom the large number of gauge data made available\\nto us, for brevity we selected a representative subset based\\non the objectives of (a) covering our region of main interest\\n– from the river Wupper in the east to the river Amblève in\\nthe west, (b) covering a range of basin sizes – from 31.9 km2\\nat gauge Schönau (Erft) to 816 km2 at gauge Kordel (Kyll),\\nand (c) covering the position along streams – wherever possible\\nwe selected two gauges per river, one in the headwater\\nand one close to its junction (see Fig. 1; river names in blue,\\ngauge names in red, reservoir names in brown). Additionally,\\nwe selected gauges of special interest, such as gauge\\nSchönau (Erft) for its proximity to retention basin Horchheim\\n(see Sect. 3.2), gauge Bliesheim (Erft) for its proximity\\nto the pit at Blessem (urban district of the town Erftstadt; see\\nSect. 3.3), and gauge Altenahr (Ahr) for the morphological\\neffects in the river Ahr (see Sect. 3.3) and its historical context\\n(cf. Part 2).\\nWater level data are from direct observations; streamflow\\ndata were calculated by the water authorities from water\\nlevel observations and gauge-specific water level–discharge\\nrelations (W–Q relations), including uncertainties of about\\n15% to 20 %. A summary of the gauge data is given in Table\\n1 (see Sect. 3.2). In cases where water level data were\\neither not available (mainly due to gauge destruction), water\\nlevels exceeded the existing W–Q relations, or W–Q relations\\nbecoming invalid because of morphological changes\\nof the river bed, streamflow data were estimated by the water\\nauthorities. In particular, the streamflow time series at\\ngauge Altenahr (Ahr) that was completely destroyed during\\nthe flood was reconstructed based on floating debris lines at\\nbuildings, recordings of upstream gauges, and observed rain-\\nNat.

In the Erft river basin, most gauges – among\\nthem Schönau and Bliesheim – were heavily bypassed during\\nthe flood, and water levels exceeded any recorded levels\\nand W–Q relations. For gauge Schönau, peak flow was estimated\\nfrom rates of change of basin volume of the flood retention\\nbasin Eicherscheid, located 1.6 km downstream of the\\ngauge. For gauge Bliesheim, the peak flow was estimated using\\na two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic model (Hydro_as-2d)\\nto reproduce observed water levels. For the model, feasible\\nranges of roughness coefficients suggest an uncertainty range\\nfor peak flow of \\x06100m3 s\\U001000001. At gauge Opladen (Wupper),\\nthe recorded peak water level of about 466 cm was also well\\nbeyond the limit of the existing W–Q relation of 400 cm.\\nStreamflow values beyond were reconstructed using a 2D hydraulic\\nmodel (Hydro_as-2d). During the flood, the river\\ncross-section at Opladen was excavated by 40 to 50 cm, making\\nthe flood not only a hydrological but also a morphological\\nevent (see also Sect. 3.3).\\n2.4 Data for the estimation of inundation areas\\nData of the earth observation satellites Sentinel-1 and\\nSentinel-2 of the Copernicus program (Sentinel Hub, 2021),\\namong others, were used to estimate the inundation areas.\\nDepending on the current ascension, new satellite imagery is\\navailable every second or third day. Sentinel-1 provides synthetic\\naperture radar imaging independent of weather conditions\\nwith a maximum spatial resolution of 5 m. These data\\nallowed us to utilize imagery as early as 15 July, independent\\nof the occurring cloud cover. In contrast, Sentinel-2 provides\\ntrue color imagery with a maximum resolution of 10 m,\\nwhich is sensitive to weather conditions. Thus, initial imagery\\nof Sentinel-2 from 16 July could not be used due to extensive\\ncloud cover. The first clear sky imagery was available\\nfrom 18 July. The Sentinel-2 imagery proved more useful due\\nto its true color imagery, as the Sentinel-1 radar images could\\nnot resolve most of the inundation areas (see Sect. 4).\\nWhile the flood was still ongoing, the CEDIM FDA task\\nforce manually gathered both aerial imagery and photos to\\nget a quick overview of the overall situation of the inundation\\narea. During this period, information about the extent\\nof the flooding was disseminated mainly through news and\\nsocial media. Some news channels broadcasted from helicopters\\nflying over the region and provided aerial imagery.\\nIn addition, private videos from drone pilots (e.g., available\\nvia YouTube) supplemented the material. In particular, information\\nfrom social media (e.g., YouTube, Twitter, Facebook)\\nprovided significant added value. Each photo and video collected\\nwas manually georeferenced and utilized to create\\ngeospatial vertices of the inundation areas. In many cases,\\nthe correct location, where a photo was taken or the flight\\npath of the helicopter or drone, had to be determined first.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023 Nat.

Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1\\nSimple landmarks such as garden fences or buildings helped.\\nBy comparing the photo and video footage with satellite images\\nacquired in previous years (e.g., Google Earth), it was\\npossible to roughly estimate the inundation areas.\\n2.5 Traffic data\\nIn order to estimate medium-term effects of the flood on\\ntransportation infrastructure, Deutsche Bahn AG (DB) provided\\ndata on rail traffic disruptions from mid-July to\\nmid-October 2021 for NRW and from mid-July to mid-\\nSeptember 2021 for RP. The DB data were pre-filtered and\\ncontain only flood-related reports. The number of disrupted\\nlines on certain key dates in the period under consideration\\n(approx. every 4 weeks) was evaluated.\\nFor the same time period, road traffic data were used,\\nwhich are equivalent to the reports issued by the police\\nto, for example, radio stations. We obtained the information\\nfrom the internet platform https://stau1.de/ (last access:\\n13 November 2022), which provides historical congestion\\nand traffic reports from Germany. As there was no prefiltering\\nfor the road data regarding the flood, we developed\\nour own filter that contains flood-related words. This ensured\\nthat all traffic reports that explicitly refer to the flood are\\nincluded. Note that if traffic reports did not contain floodrelated\\nwords but were induced by the flood, they were not\\nevaluated. In order to check the validity of the data, the analysis\\nwas supplemented by quality controls. Reports for the\\nsame route and route section were combined.\\n2.6 Extreme value statistics\\nIn both parts of this two-paper series, extreme value statistics\\nwere used to estimate return periods TRP.x/ of precipitation\\nevents x (or vice versa, xRV.T /) from both observations\\n(Part 1) and model data (Part 2). Making use of the\\nPeak-over-threshold approach (POT; Wilks, 2006), only precipitation\\nevents above the 95th percentile were considered\\nfor the analysis. To this upper tail of the distribution, a threeparameter\\ngeneralized Pareto distribution (GPD) was fitted\\n(e.g., van Montfort and Witter, 1986; Coles et al., 2001;\\nBrabson and Palutikof, 2000). The scale parameter and the\\nshape parameter resulted from the fit using the maximum\\nlikelihood estimation (MLE). The statistical uncertainty of\\nthe return periods (95% confidence interval) was estimated\\nusing a bivariate normal distribution (Kotz and Nadarajah,\\n2000).\\nAdjusting statistical distribution functions to a data series\\nallows for estimating high return periods beyond the\\navailable time period. Furthermore, the comparatively strong\\nnoise or high random component of an empirical return period\\nestimation (e.g., block maximum) is reduced to a certain\\ndegree (e.g., Bezak et al., 2014).\\n2.7 Loss modeling\\nUsing the loss models available in CEDIM (e.g., Daniell\\net al., 2011, 2018; Mühr et al., 2017) and empirical data from\\npast flood disasters (hazard information, infrastructural, and\\nother damage), a first rapid loss assessment was carried out\\nas part of the FDA activity immediately after the flood event\\n(Schäfer et al., 2021). A central element for this assessment\\nwas a very large natural hazard database with over 60 000 entries\\n(CATDAT; Daniell et al., 2011, 2016; EEA, 2022) built\\nup by CEDIM in recent years.\\nThe following characteristics and assumptions were made\\nas part of the damage modeling:\\na. Based on the inundation areas, 9694 buildings in RP and\\n9702 buildings in NRW were identified to be affected.\\nb. Based on the capital stock model used in Wilhelm et al.\\n(2021), a capital stock of EUR8.92 billion (excluding\\ninfrastructure) was associated with these buildings.\\nc. The damage ratio defined within the flooded locations\\nof the inundation areas ranged between 15% and 33%\\n(economic damage as percentage of capital stock). This\\nwas derived from previous analyses of past flood events.\\nThe damage ratio range was derived from the proportional\\nintegration of various vulnerability curves with\\nbuilding stock data of the most affected areas in NRW\\nand RP assuming a typical building style of 2–3-story\\nbuildings.\\nd. Given the unknown number of affected buildings and\\ninfrastructure outside of the estimated footprints from\\nSect. 4.1, scaling factors ranging between 3.4 and 8.1\\nwere used to estimate the share of damage in these regions.\\nThese scaling factors represent the additional exposure\\nvs. that of the mapped inundation areas. This\\napproach is in line with existing studies under the\\nWorld Bank’s global rapid post-disaster damage estimation\\n(GRADE) methodology (Gunasekera et al., 2018)1\\nwhen estimating damage in locations where absolute inundation\\ndepths are unknown.\\n3 Event description and analysis\\nIn terms of addressing the research question of what made the\\nJuly 2021 flood event so extraordinary, it is becoming clear\\nthat several factors at various spatial and temporal scales\\nwere decisive for the catastrophic July 2021 flood event.\\n1The GRADE approach, developed by theWorld Bank and supported\\nby the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery\\n(GFDRR), is designed to provide governments and other key\\nstakeholders involved in post-disaster damage assessment, relief,\\nand recovery phases with initial rapid estimations of physical postdisaster\\ndamage within 2 weeks.\\nNat.

Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1 531\\nBased on analyses of model and observational data and complemented\\nby our own simulations and assessments, we discuss\\nin the following the complex interactions between meteorological\\n(Sect. 3.1), hydrological (Sect. 3.2), and hydromorphodynamic\\n(Sect. 3.3) processes and mechanisms.\\n3.1 Meteorological aspects\\n3.1.1 Atmospheric conditions prior and during the\\nflood event\\nSynoptic overview and atmospheric characteristics\\nOn 10 July 2021, a prominent upper-level trough was located\\nover the Atlantic Ocean, moving rapidly to the southeast.\\nTwo days later, the trough structure with its meridional\\noriented axis extended from the western North Sea across\\nthe English Channel and the western half of France to the\\nBalearic Islands. Subsequently, the upper-level trough was\\nblocked by a quasi-stationary anticyclone located over northeastern\\nEurope, which had already remained in the region\\nfor 3 weeks (not shown). Ahead of the approaching trough,\\nthe air pressure began to drop and a surface low pressure\\nsystem named Bernd formed over the North German Plain\\n(dashed 1010 hPa contour in Fig. 2a), exactly where the most\\nintense precipitation was later observed. Bernd and the associated\\nfrontal system moved first very slowly eastward,\\nwith its center moving from southern Switzerland/northwestern\\nItaly across the Alps towards southern Germany, and at\\nlater stages retrograde (westward). Analyses of the middle\\ntroposphere reveal a shortwave trough on the northwestern\\nflank of the low pressure system (solid contour in Fig. 2a),\\nwhich provided an additional atmospheric uplift, increasing\\nthe precipitation intensity. The extensive central European\\nlow pressure complex included extremely moist air masses in\\nits circulation (colored areas in Fig. 2a). Over northern Germany,\\nvery high values of total precipitable water of more\\nthan 40 kgm\\U001000002 were reached.\\nThese very high values of total precipitable water suggest\\nthat the moisture-laden air masses contributed to the extreme\\nprecipitation totals in the affected region. In order to investigate\\nthe pathway of the moisture-laden air mass and to identify\\npossible source regions of moisture prior to the event,\\nwe evaluated the 10 d history of air masses with the trajectory\\napproach (see Sect. 2.1). As we were particularly interested\\nin moisture uptake due to surface evaporation, we focused\\non air parcels at the time when they were located in the\\nplanetary boundary layer (PBL). The density of air parcels\\nlocated in the PBL over the entire 10 d period is shown in\\nFig. 2b. The majority were located over northern central Europe,\\nthe North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. From there, the air\\nmasses were transported towards the affected region on the\\nnorthern flank of Bernd. Considering all air parcels in and\\nabove the PBL, a similar spatial distribution was obtained\\n(not shown). The large fraction over the North and Baltic\\nseas is noteworthy since both regions were characterized by\\nunusual SST anomalies of up to 8K during this period (colored\\ncontours in Fig. 2b), which was a consequence of the\\nblocking situation described above and the associated cloudfree\\nconditions and high solar insolation. This indicates that\\nsurface evaporation over the North Sea and Baltic Sea served\\nas major moisture source prior to the event. Similar conclusions\\nwere also drawn by Tuel et al. (2022), who in addition\\nto the unusual SST anomalies over the North and Baltic\\nseas established a connection with the repeated Rossby wave\\nbreaking caused by a persistent meridionally amplified flow\\nover the Atlantic, initiating a favorable dynamic setting on\\nthe large-scale for extremes. Heavy precipitation associated\\nwith quasi-stationary low pressure systems, their fronts, or\\nconvective systems located on the western flank of persistent\\nblocking systems is observed frequently in Europe during\\nsummer and has often led to weather extremes with severe\\n(economic) consequences (Grams et al., 2014; Piper\\net al., 2016; Lenggenhager and Martius, 2019; Mohr et al.,\\n2019, 2020; Kautz et al., 2022).\\nPrecipitation fields and statistics\\nAs a result of upper-level shortwave troughs, a large area\\nwith widespread heavy precipitation formed over southwestern\\nGermany already in the morning of 13 July (see Figs. S1a\\nand S2a in the Supplement). This happened in accordance\\nwith the cyclonic rotation around the trough, and the precipitation\\narea first moved northeastward, then northward, before\\nturning westward over northern Germany and finally finding\\nits way into NRW and RP. The heavy precipitation event\\nleading to the devastating floods was predominantly stratiform\\nin nature, but with embedded areas of convective heavier\\nrain as shown by radar imagery (not shown). The rain began\\nduring the early morning hours on 14 July, for example,\\nat the DWD weather station in Cologne-Stammheim around\\n04:00 UTC (see Fig. S3). In the Ahr catchment, precipitation\\nstarted almost at the same time, for example at the DWD\\nstation of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, located near the mouth\\ninto the Rhine, at around 05:00 UTC. Initially, it rained only\\nlightly and irregularly, but covering almost the entire catchment\\narea from about 09:30 UTC. Around noon, precipitation\\nintensified, and between 13:30 and 17:30 UTC, the highest\\nprecipitation intensities were observed in the Eifel region.\\nFrom 17:30 UTC onwards, precipitation weakened from the\\neast, and before midnight, the rain event ceased. Thus, the\\nmajor part of the precipitation totals contributing to the flood\\nfell in the affected river catchments within approximately\\n15 h on 14 July.\\nDuring this period, precipitation totals of up to 150mm\\nwere recorded, for example, at Cologne-Stammheim (see\\nFig. S3 and Table S1 in the Supplement). The maximum\\nhourly precipitation intensity reached 33 mm. The long-term\\naverage for the month of July at this station, however, is only\\n69mm (1981–2010).

Thus,\\nthe rain amounts exceeded the usual monthly July precipitation\\nat most of the stations.\\nThe large spatial extent of the high precipitation area can\\nalso be clearly seen in the RADOLAN data (Figs. 3a and S1).\\nOur focus region regarding precipitation is largely represented\\nby the larger blackrectangle in Fig. 3 (w.r.t. Part 2\\nhereafter LReg), while the smaller black rectangle (hereafter\\nSReg, cf. part 2 Sect. 2 for details) covers the highest precipitation\\ntotals with the mainly affected Ahr catchment (red\\ncontour). On average, the 24 h precipitation totals on 14 July\\naccording to RADOLAN were 55.4mm in the LReg and\\n75.2mm in the SReg. On the same day, high precipitation\\ntotals of more than 50mm were also observed over larger\\nareas in the adjacent regions of Belgium and Luxembourg.\\nTogether with rain amounts of 20 to 50mm already fallen on\\nthe previous day (see Fig. S2a), this resulted in 48 h rain sums\\nof more than 75mm (Fig. S2b). Note that Saadi et al. (2022)\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\nS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1 533\\nrecently pointed out an underestimation of RADOLAN for\\nthis particular event of about 15% to 20% compared to station\\ndata.\\nFor a first climatological classification of the precipitation\\nevent, return periods were calculated using the GPD with the\\nPOT method (see Sect. 2.6) based on 65 years of HYRAS\\ndata as reference. For this purpose, the 24 h precipitation totals\\nof RADOLAN were interpolated on the HYRAS grid.\\nThe rather large area with high precipitation totals is reflected\\nin high return periods (Fig. 3b) exceeding over 100 years.\\nEspecially in the southern part of the figure near the border\\nbetween Germany and Luxembourg, observed rainfall was\\nexceptionally high in a statistical context: on average, the return\\nperiod was approximately 500 years (95% confidence\\ninterval 40 to 2\\x02108 years) in LReg and 800 years (95%\\nconfidence interval 50 to 4\\x02107 years) in SReg. This is the\\nsame order of magnitudes as in other studies. For example,\\nKreienkamp et al. (2021) and Tradowsky et al. (2022) estimated\\na return period of at least 400 years for an event with\\nsimilar magnitude and extent occurring anywhere in the area\\nin western Europe between the Alps and the Netherlands. Dietze\\net al. (2022) showed that the sub-daily as well as daily\\nand multi-day precipitation totals at the DWD weather station\\nWeilerswist-Lommersum (Erft catchment) exceeded the\\n500-year return level. According to the KOSTRA classification\\nof DWD (KOSTRA-DWD-2010R), 24 h totals also\\nexceeded the 100-year return level in a larger area between\\nCologne and the borders to Luxembourg and Belgium (see\\nFig. S4 including data description in the Supplement).\\n3.1.2 Weather forecast analysis\\nIn the following section, the predictability of the event is analyzed\\nbased on weather forecasts by DWD and ECMWF\\n(see Sect. 2.1). The deterministic forecast runs of the DWD\\nICON-EU model show the potential for a widespread heavy\\nprecipitation event in the border region between western\\nGermany, eastern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the\\nNetherlands as early as 12 July 00:00UTC (see Fig. S5).\\nWhile the affected area and intensity varies over the next\\nforecasts, the potential for an extraordinary event in this\\nregion remains. Specifically for the affected area (LReg),\\nhigh 24 h precipitation totals (within the range of the observations;\\nsee Sect. 3.1.1) were predicted more than 2 d\\n(from 12 July 00:00 UTC) ahead of the event (blue dots in\\nFig. 4a). The DWD ICON-D2 forecasts also captured the\\nmagnitude of the event right from of their first initialization\\n(13 July 06:00 UTC; red dots in Fig. 4a), as can also be\\nseen in the spatial distribution of the precipitation forecasts\\nby ICON-D2 and ICON-D2-EPS for different initialization\\ntimes (Fig. S6). They consistently depict high precipitation\\ntotals over a wide area around the border between NRW, RP,\\nBelgium, and Luxembourg, locally exceeding 150mmd\\U001000001.\\nEspecially for the affected area, both ICON-EU and ICOND2\\nforecasts oscillate around the observed precipitation totals\\n(Fig. 4a), with even slightly higher predicted totals compared\\nto the observations for the initialization shortly ahead\\nof the start of the event. The DWD ICON-D2-EPS predictions\\n(gray box plots in Fig. 4a) clearly show that the closer\\nthey were initialized to the event, the more the uncertainty\\nof the prediction decreased. The predictions of the ECMWFEPS\\nalso indicated the possibility of an unusual event early\\non (Fig. 4b). EFI values (see Sect. 2.1) above 0.5 are obtained\\nfrom the forecasts initialized on 10 and 11 July 2021.\\nFrom 12 July on, also 2 d before the event, the EFI for 24 h\\nprecipitation exceeds values of 0.8, indicating a very high\\nprobability of occurrence of a very unusual or extreme event\\nin this region. The above results show that while the precise\\nprediction of the rainfall totals for the affected areas as only\\npossible a few hours in advance, the potential for a extraordinary\\nprecipitation event in the region was given at least 2 d\\nin advance.\\n3.2 Hydrological aspects\\nIn this section, we discuss the hydrological aspects of the\\nevent, including antecedent conditions in the catchments,\\nriver water levels and streamflow, effects on reservoirs, and\\na comparison of observed peak values with statistical design\\nfloods. However, we did not estimate statistical return periods\\nof the July 2021 flood for several reasons. The first reason\\nis that during the event, many gauging stations were partly\\nor completely destroyed, and even if water level recordings\\nexisted, water level–discharge relations (W–Q relations) at\\nmany gauges were severely altered during the flood due to\\ndynamical river bed changes or backwater effects from floating\\ndebris trapped upstream of bridges (see Sect. 3.3). Furthermore,\\nthe water levels observed during the flood were often\\nall-time records exceeding existing W–Q relations. Reconstructing\\nevent discharge, the basis for a statistical treatment,\\nis therefore a difficult and still ongoing task, and the\\nvalues reported below should be interpreted as the best available\\nto date but not as final estimates. Nevertheless, and despite\\nconsiderable uncertainties, often the sheer magnitude of\\nthe estimates underline the exceptional nature of the event.\\n3.2.1 Antecedent conditions\\nAnalyzing major historical floods in Germany, Schröter et al.\\n(2015) found that they were triggered either by extensive\\nprecipitation events following a normal to dry period, or by\\nmoderate precipitation events following an exceptionally wet\\nperiod. This means that catchment preconditions – namely\\nsoil wetness – are a crucial factor for flood occurrence\\nand/or magnitude. For the 30 d prior to the event, API values\\n(Sect. 2.2) quantified by RADOLAN data show a moderate\\nwet period in most of Germany (Fig. S7a). Widespread values\\nrange between 20 and 60 mm, with spatial averages of\\n55.0mm for LReg and 49.7mm for SReg. This agrees with\\nJunghänel et al. (2021), who reported frequent rainfall in this\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023 Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n534 S.

As a consequence, their flood\\ndynamics were quite similar and we therefore discuss them\\ntogether here. In their headwaters (Fig. 6a, c, and e), with the\\nonset of rainfall (see Sect. 3.1.1), water levels started rising in\\nthe morning of 14 July (08:00–10:00 UTC) and reached peak\\nlevels in the evening (20:00–22:00 UTC). Within only 12 h,\\nwater levels rose by about 3m at Kyll and Prüm and by more\\nthan 5m at the Ahr. All peak values were clearly beyond the\\npeak flows of a 100-year flood event (HQ100), for Müsch\\neven by a factor of about 3 (Table 1). After the peak, water\\nlevels in the headwaters started gradually declining, and by\\naround midnight of the following day (15 July) the flood had\\nended.\\nAt the downstream gauges (Fig. 6b, d, and f), peak water\\nlevels were reached in the early morning of 15 July\\n(00:00 UTC at gauge Altenahr, 08:30 UTC at gauge Kordel,\\n05:30 UTC at gauge Prümzurlay). Like for the headwater\\ngauges, water levels rose dramatically within only 12 h: almost\\n6m at Kordel, almost 7m at Prümzurlay, and almost\\n10m at Altenahr. Likewise, the estimated peak flows are all\\nclearly above the statistical HQ100 values, with a record factor\\nof about 4 at gauge Altenahr (Table 1). Owing to its\\ndeeply incised topography, forcing settled areas into close\\nvicinity of the river and leaving very little floodplains for safe\\ninundation, the villages along the river Ahr were severely\\naffected by the flood, including a large number of fatalities\\n(see Sect. 4). Another consequence of the steep terrain and\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023 Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n536 S. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1\\nconstricted conditions at the Ahr were high flow velocities,\\nerosion, and transport of floating debris, causing substantial\\nblocking and backwater effects (see Sect. 3.3). The estimated\\npeak flow of about 900 to 1000m3 s\\U001000001 (Fig. 6b) corresponds\\nwell with estimates of 1000 to 1200m3 s\\U001000001 based\\non hydraulic considerations by Roggenkamp and Hergert\\n(2022). It is also noteworthy that while large historical\\nfloods (in 1804 and 1910) have been documented at the Ahr\\n(Roggenkamp and Herget, 2014a, b), only data from the\\ncontinuous records starting in 1973 were used to estimate\\nHQ100 values (see Part 2 for a detailed discussion).\\n3.2.3 Erft river basin\\nLike the rivers Ahr, Kyll, and Prüm, the river Erft originates\\nin the Eifel, but it drains northward towards its confluence\\nwith the Rhine near the city of Düsseldorf (see Fig. 1). In\\nthe Erft headwater region, 130 to 150mm of rain fell on\\n14 July, with highest intensities occurring between 10:00 and\\n19:00 UTC. As a consequence, the water level at headwater\\ngauge Schönau (Fig. 6g), for example, started rising at\\n07:00 UTC, reaching its peak at 18:50 UTC in the evening,\\nmore than 5 times larger than the statistical HQ100 of the\\ngauge. At gauge Bliesheim (Fig. 6h), 36 km downstream\\nof Schönau, water levels started rising about 6 h later, but\\n– due to the operation of the retention basins Eicherscheid\\nand Horchheim located in-between – reached its peak only\\nat 08:45 UTC on the following day. While the operation of\\nthe reservoirs delayed the peak somewhat, they were far too\\nsmall to significantly reduce the flood peak: at Bliesheim,\\nthe maximum discharge exceeded the statistical HQ100 by\\na factor of more than 7 (Table 1), which is even higher than\\nfor Schönau. In fact, the magnitude of the flood not only rendered\\nflood reduction by reservoir operation impossible, it\\neven posed a great threat to many retention basins in the region\\nmost affected. As a typical example, we briefly summarize\\nthe course of events at retention basin Horchheim\\n(see Fig. 1). It was built in the 1980s and is operated by\\nthe Erftverband for downstream flood protection. The reservoir\\nvolume and outlet gates are designed for protection\\nfrom HQ100 D 58m3 s\\U001000001, the design flood for ensuring dam\\nstability is HQ10 000 D 90m3 s\\U001000001. In the night from 14 to\\n15 July, water entering the reservoir exceeded any recorded\\nvalues. Between 02:00 and 05:00UTC in the morning of\\n15 July, i.e., in only 3 h, total inflow exceeded twice the\\nentire retention volume. The peak inflow was estimated as\\nabout 390m3 s\\U001000001, which is about 4 times the HQ10 000. As\\na consequence, and despite all flood gates opened, the dam\\novertopped at 05:35 UTC, causing destruction of all service\\ninfrastructure and partial destruction of the dam by backward\\nerosion (Erftverband, 2021). Similar situations were –\\namong many others – encountered at retention basins Eicherscheid\\nand Niederberg and service water reservoir Steinbachtalsperre\\n(all located in the Erft basin) and Urfttalsperre\\n(river Urft, see Fig. 1). For the latter, the design discharge for\\ndam stability of HQ10 000 D 289m3 s\\U001000001 was surpassed by a\\nfactor of more than about 1 on the morning of 15 July (estimated\\npeak flow is about 320m3 s\\U001000001), fortunately without\\ndam failure (Bung, 2021).\\n3.2.4 Wupper river basin\\nUnlike the above discussed river basins, the Wupper river\\nbasin is located east of the Rhine (see Fig. 1). It is characterized\\nby low mountain terrain and several reservoirs, most\\nof them operated by the Wupperverband. The largest reservoir\\nis the Wupper-Talsperre. It has an upstream basin size\\nof 212 km2 and an overall storage volume of 25:6\\x02106 m3;\\nadditionally, 9:9\\x02106 m3 are available for flood retention.\\nGauge Hückeswagen (Table 1 and Fig. 6i) is just upstream\\nof the reservoir, and gauge Opladen (Table 1 and Fig. 6j)\\nis far downstream, close to the confluence with the Rhine\\n(see Fig. 1). Just like in the Eifel region west of the Rhine,\\nthe rainfall event in the Wupper basin on 14 July was characterized\\nby high intensities, large sums, and large spatial\\nextent (see Fig. 3a): in an area larger than 1000 km2,\\n120 to 150mm of rainfall were recorded within 24 h on\\n14 July. Even compared to point statistics, these totals exceed\\n200-year return intervals (see Fig. 3b), in combination\\nwith its areal extent the return period is even more extreme\\nand hard to quantify (cf. PART2). As a consequence,\\nwater levels and discharge at gauge Hückeswagen rose to\\nmagnitudes almost 3 times larger than the previously largest\\nrecorded flood and the statistical 100-year flood (Table 1).\\nAt about 15:00 UTC, the gauge was completely inundated\\nand data transfer stopped. Thanks to warnings by DWD, the\\nWupper-Talsperre water level was drawn down at increasing\\nrates since 12 July, creating additional retention volume\\nprior to the flood. Despite these measures, its maximum\\nwater level was reached and exceeded at 22:00 UTC\\non 14 July, and the flood spillway was activated to prevent\\ndam failure. Overall, and largely thanks to the preevent\\nwater level drawdown, the reservoir fulfilled its protection\\ntask by reducing the unprecedented maximum inflow\\nof about 230 to about 190m3 s\\U001000001 downstream (Wupperverband,\\n2021). At theWupper-Talsperre, like for the previously\\nmentioned reservoirs Horchheim and Urfttalsperre, the maximum\\ninflow exceeded even the HQ10 000 D 168m3 s\\U001000001 design\\ndischarge, here by a factor of about 1.3. Despite the mitigating\\neffect of the reservoir operation, and largely owing\\nto the effect of the large intermediate catchment area, peak\\nwater levels and streamflow at downstream gauge Opladen\\nalso were the largest ever recorded, exceeding the statistical\\n100-year flood by a factor of more than 2 (Table 1).\\n3.2.5 Rivers in Belgium and Luxembourg\\nFlooding in Belgium occurred mainly in the southeastern\\nparts, on tributaries to the river Meuse, originating from the\\nEifel and Ardennes region (see Fig. 1). Especially along the\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\nS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1 537\\nrivers Ourthe (basin size 1850 km2), Amblève (1100 km2)\\nand Vesdre (700 km2), previously unobserved peak water\\nlevels and streamflow values were reached, leading to 39 fatalities\\nand vast damage to buildings and infrastructure (Dewals\\net al., 2021). Rainfall amounts close to 200mm in 24 h\\nwere observed in the region, which is far beyond the statistical\\n200-year return period (Dewals et al., 2021). For example,\\npeak flow at the Ourthe river just upstream the Vesdre\\nconfluence was estimated to be about 1100m3 s\\U001000001, which\\nis about 50% above the previously observed maximum and\\nabout 25% above the statistical 100-year flood. Along other\\nrivers such as the Vesdre, evidence from partial gauge observations\\n(most were destroyed during the flood) suggests that\\n100-year floods were exceeded by a factor of about 3 (Dewals\\net al., 2021).\\nIn Luxembourg, severe flooding occurred mainly along the\\nrivers Alzette, Sur, and Our, and along tributaries in the east\\nand southeast of the Grand Duchy (see Fig. 1). As a result of\\nwidespread 24 h precipitation totals reaching 100mm (MeteoLux,\\n2021), streamflow surpassed the statistical HQ100 at\\n10 river gauges; at 15 gauges it was the highest ever recorded,\\nresulting in widespread inundations and evacuation (AGE,\\n2021).\\n3.3 Hydro-morphodynamic processes\\nThe July 2021 flood in Germany demonstrated that floodinduced\\nalterations in the morphology of landscape, river\\nchannels, and urban areas have great potential to destruct and\\ndamage housing, farm land, industry, crucial infrastructure,\\nand natural areas (see also Sect. 4; cf. also Dewals et al.,\\n2021). Immediately after an extreme event, data on morphology\\nchanges in the valleys are sparse and unstructured.\\nThe time required to reconstruct hydro-morphodynamic processes\\nwith numerical models happening at this spatial\\nscale is not compatible with an immediate post-event survey.\\nTherefore, our analysis and interpretation are based\\non a qualitative assessment that draws on photo and video\\nelements collected from social media, as well as historical\\nreports, images, and topography. We complement information\\nalready advanced in other works on how hydromorphodynamic\\naspects are related to an enhancement of\\nhazard in the July 2021 floods (i.e., Dietze et al., 2022), focusing\\nmore specifically on (i) hydrodynamic and geomorphic\\nprocesses in the channel network; (ii) morphology (natural\\nor anthropic) channel network singularities; and (iii) anthropic\\nmodification of the catchment.\\n3.3.1 Fluvial morphology as a dynamic system\\nIn the municipality of Rech (Ahrweiler district), for instance,\\nthe erosion and collapse of the right bank of the river\\nAhr destructed houses and infrastructure (cf. cover photo\\nat Petermann, 2021). Another very visible morphological\\neffect was the destruction of gauging stations (e.g., Altenahr;\\nsee Sect. 3.2) by local scour, bank erosion, and collapse,\\nwhich hindered the hydrological monitoring and reconstruction\\nof the event. In the municipality of Dernau (see\\nSect. 4.1 Fig. 10 for orientation), human-induced changes in\\nthe valley changed the response of the river network to floods\\nover time; while the peak flood discharge estimated for the\\nJuly 2021 flood was in the same order of magnitude as for the\\n1804 event (cf. Part 2 and Roggenkamp and Hergert, 2022),\\nthe flood level in 2021 was about 2.4m higher (Fig. 7a).\\nDernau is located on a relatively wide section of the Ahr\\nvalley; immediately downstream, the river becomes singlethreaded\\nand narrow for approximately 2 km, widening again\\njust upstream of the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. This\\ndownstream bottleneck makes Dernau naturally prone to water\\naccumulation and consequent inundation due to backwater\\neffects. Between 1804 and 2021, more precisely in\\nthe 1880s, the railroad of the Ahr valley (Ahrtalbahn) was\\nconstructed and four bridges were built precisely in the bottleneck\\nriver reach, which narrowed even further the channel\\ncross-section. During the July 2021 flood, these bridges were\\ndestroyed along with the Ahr valley railroad (Fig. 7b). From\\nthe post-event analysis, we may argue that the higher peak\\nwater level – compared to 1804 – were due to a combination\\nof both (a) the anthropogenic morphology change of the\\nvalley geometry, more specifically of the river cross-section,\\nimposed by the construction of the railroad bridges, which increased\\nthe bottleneck effect; and (b) the probable damming\\nand clogging of the river cross-sections at the location of\\nthe bridges by the trapping of large-scale debris transported\\nfrom the upstream valley (in Fig. 7b) remains of this debris,\\nmainly wood, are visible). Large volumes of large-scale debris,\\nincluding wood; industrial components, such as vehicles\\nand caravans, bins and containers; and construction materials\\nwere observed throughout the river channel network in\\nthe post-event survey. Most of this debris was nonexistent or\\nlimited in 1804.\\n3.3.2 More than water: sediment and debris\\nThe July 2021 event was a showcase of how the excess of\\nsediment reaching the river network, and changes in river\\nmorphology due to the excess of flow energy to perform geomorphic\\nwork, interact non-linearly with the flood propagation.\\nIn the post-event survey we observed, in all affected\\nvalleys with no exception, that river sections and streets were\\npartially and sometimes entirely dammed by organic and inorganic\\nlarge-scale debris, often with dimensions comparable\\nto the cross-section available to the flow (cf. tweet on\\nTwitter from NoeWehrtSich, 2021). Assuming that the transport\\nof large debris follows the same modes as described in\\nRuiz-Villanueva et al. (2019) for large wood, the post-events\\nimages taken at the river Ahr indicate that, at least for some\\nmoments during the event, the large debris was transported\\nin the so-called congested and hypercongested regimes, in\\nwhich the debris elements are constantly in contact and are\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023 Nat.

We believe that\\nthe magnitude of the overland and river flows reported previously\\n(see Sect. 3.2) corresponded to large periods when\\nthe flow exceeding the threshold for recruitment of sediment\\nand debris, and that when the peak discharge occurred the\\nchannel network was already clogged with solid material.\\n3.3.3 Natural and anthropogenic landscape\\nsingularities\\nIn a river catchment, many natural and anthropogenic singularities\\ndisrupt the continuity of the landscape and river\\nnetwork. The most visible anthropogenic singularities in valleys,\\nwhich influence and are affected by floods, are bridges.\\nFekete and Sandholz (2021) refer to the destruction of\\n62 bridges, whereas BMI (2022) estimated that 103 bridges\\nwere damaged or completely destroyed during the July 2021\\nflood event, only in the Ahr valley. Several reasons can be\\npointed out for the bridge collapses, as in the two examples\\nin the Ahrweiler district (see Fig. 7b and c): foundation excavation\\nand scouring, impact and hydrodynamic action, lateral\\nerosion of the abutments, and bank failure.\\nEphemeral morphology features such as channel section\\nblockage are provoked by the accumulation of sediments\\nand debris, and these occurred at several locations during\\nthe July 2021 flood, as observed extensively in the survey\\nand shown in social media. The eventual destruction and\\ncollapse of these impounding incidents caused downstream\\nflood bursts (cf. also Fekete and Sandholz, 2021) with extra\\ndebris-charged peak flows traveling downstream as an abrupt\\nfront (with similar effects to dam break flows).\\nAn (anthropogenic) landscape fragility in the Erft catchment\\nhad unforeseen consequences (and excessive media exposure):\\na mining pit as deep as 50m and with an area of\\nroughly 25 ha, located northwest of the town of Erftstadt\\n(Erft catchment, Rhein-Erft-Kreis district). During the beginning\\nof 15 July, the urban district of Blessem of the town of\\nErftstadt was inundated, and the flood flowed freely through\\nthe streets, roughly from south to north. The pathway of the\\nwater downstream through the town was along the natural\\nlandscape gradient and eventually into the pit through an existing\\ndepression on its south levee. This flow pattern corresponded\\nremarkably to what the simulations from the flood\\nhazard map produced by the district government of Cologne\\npreviewed for both cases: a flood with a return period of\\n100 years and an extreme flood (Bezirksregierung Köln,\\n2019). When the water started flowing on the pit slope, an unexpected\\nmajor process of retro dendritic (tree-shaped) erosion\\noccurred, which reached the urban district of Blessem\\nin 6 to 8 h (Fig. 8). Eight houses were destroyed and considerable\\ndamage was reported to infrastructure and other\\nbuildings and assets. During the night of 15 to 16 July, the\\ndendritic shape of the erosion reached the river Erft and redirected\\nit into the pit; the configuration of the landscape drastically\\nchanged within 1.5 d. A flood attenuation side effect\\nwas observed once the river Erft was connected to the mining\\npit: the flood volume was partially absorbed by the reservoir\\nformed by the pit. A valley bypass occurred through the road\\ntunnel in the municipality of Altenahr constructed in 1834.\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\nS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1 539\\nFigure 8. View of the pit Blessem (belongs to Erftstadt) during the\\nflood with the location of the later connection of the river Erft to the\\npit (Maurice, 2021). Blue arrow shows the river flow direction.\\nWhen the flood in July 2021 reached a level higher than\\nthe western entrance of the road tunnel of the federal highway\\nB267, the water started flowing freely through it, bypassing\\na 3 km meander of the river Ahr. Meanders generally\\ncontribute to peak flow attenuation (Buffin-Bélanger et al.,\\n2015); in this particular case we argue that the bypass resulted\\nin an increase (but non-significant) in the downstream\\ndischarge. Considerable destruction was caused at the eastern\\ntunnel outlet, where massive scouring of the road and the\\nneighboring slope occurred. A scour erosion step of more\\nthan 4m was created, through which the water passed as\\na waterfall. Furthermore, the bypassed flow conditioned the\\nflow in the downstream river, influencing its morphology and\\ncreating new areas of deposition and erosion.\\n3.3.4 3D hydrodynamic complex processes\\nIn the municipality of Schuld (see Fig. 10 for orientation)\\nand in the urban district of Altenburg (municipality of Altenahr),\\nboth located in a meandering region of the river Ahr,\\ncomplex 3D hydrodynamic processes with consequences for\\nflood propagation (as discussed in Bates, 2022) were observed.\\nThe southern part of the urban settlement of Schuld\\nis located on the left-hand side of the inner region of an\\nAhr bend, an expected deposition area (cf. Blanckaert and\\nde Vriend, 2003). During the July 2021 flood, the flow inundated\\nthis area of the urban settlement. Water charged with\\nsediment and debris circulated through the streets, and the\\nsolid material deposited, with serious consequences for the\\nsecurity of the dwellers and buildings (see Fig. 9).\\nIn the second case, the water over-topped the levee of the\\nriver Ahr and was directed towards an old meander on the\\nright-hand side riverbank, flooding the southeast of the urban\\ndistrict of Altenburg (see Fig. 11). The spreading of the\\nflow through what possibly is an abandoned oxbow lake may\\nhave contributed to an attenuation of the downstream peak\\nflow through the flood lamination effect (not measured but\\nnot expected to be significant in this case).

In total, at least 180 people lost their\\nlives (see Table S2), 69 of them in the Ahrweiler district (RP)\\nalong the river Ahr, and over 800 people were seriously injured\\n(BMI, 2022). The Ahr valley was the location affected\\nmost severely, with an estimated 17 000 out of 42 000 people\\nlosing most of their property (BMI, 2022). Due to gaps in the\\ninformation warning chains (cf. Fekete and Sandholz, 2021;\\nThieken et al., 2022) and no widespread evacuations, many\\npeople surprised by the fast rising floodwaters were unable\\nto get to safe places or underestimated the imminent danger,\\nrespectively (e.g., attempting to save belongings from\\nthe basement).\\nWhile the flood was ongoing and during the first days\\nand weeks thereafter, the overall situation on site was relatively\\nuncertain, which posed a major problem for crisis\\nmanagement, emergency personnel, and the provision of relief\\nsupplies. As part of CEDIM’s concept of FDAs (see\\nSect. 1), a first rapid assessment of the situation on site was\\ncarried out within a few days after the event (cf. Schäfer\\net al., 2021) to obtain initial estimates of the inundation areas\\n(Sect. 4.1), the associated potential losses (Sect. 4.2), and further\\nconsequences such as rail and road damage and blocking\\n(Sect. 4.3).\\n4.1 Estimation of inundation areas in a rapid context\\nOne of the first steps in rapid disaster analyses is to estimate\\nthe event’s footprints and to identify affected areas.

The onset of the event started in the late hours of\\n14 July and lasted until 16 July (see Fig. 6). While the flooding\\nwas still ongoing, live imagery (e.g., helicopters, drones)\\nand social media imagery (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) was manually\\ncollected and processed as part of the CEDIM FDA\\n(Sect. 2.4). Initially, it was unclear which towns and villages\\nwere flooded and to what extent, and how severe the flooding\\nmight be. This was not only the case for the Ahr valley, but\\nalso for most other affected regions such as along the river\\nErft. River gauge stations only provided limited information\\nabout the actual water level (destroyed gauges, see Sect. 3.2).\\nIn addition to the mentioned visual material above,\\nSentinel-1 imagery (see Sect. 2.4) and analyses of automatic\\nprocedures by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches\\nZentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR, 2021) were integrated\\ninto the analyses (from 15 July) to identify further\\nflooded areas. However, one constraint was that Sentinel-\\n1’s automated procedure is sensitive to topography and,\\nfor example, often identified hillslopes as inundation areas.\\nNonetheless, the information was an additional proxy\\nto identify flooded areas, especially for regions without\\navailable photos or videos. News media focused mainly on\\nseverely affected places such as the town of Bad Neuenahr-\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\nS.

In some cases, this gap was closed\\nby private footage, but this was not always the case.\\nOn 17 July, Sentinel-2 imagery was made available, allowing\\nfurther flooded areas to be identified despite some cloud\\ncover and confirming previous findings. However, due to the\\nlow resolution of the imagery, manual assessment was necessary,\\nfor example by comparing the imagery with topography\\ndata to differentiate between flooded and muddy areas.\\nOne problem was that the mud extended to roads, due\\nto traffic and rain, that were not flooded. In addition, some\\nmuddy roads were also caused by downhill water streams.\\nFurthermore, from 19 July, first assessments by the Copernicus\\nEmergency Management Service (CEMS, 2021) were\\nadded, which were similar but showed gaps as well.\\nFigure 10 provides an overview of the final product for\\nthe Ahr valley, where about 17 km2 of flooded area was\\nmapped between the two municipalities of Antweiler and\\nSinzig (distance around 34 km), excluding areas for which\\nno image data were available. Zoomed in, Fig. 11 compared\\nexemplary different assessment products of the inundation\\narea for the river loop near the municipality of\\nAltenahr (red box in Fig. 10). For this specific region\\nnear Altenahr, photos highly supported the reconstruction\\nof the inundation area (e.g., see tweet on Twitter: https://\\ntwitter.com/WxNB_/status/1415629704472760324, last access:\\n13 November 2022). It can be clearly seen that purely\\nsatellite-based (automated) products based on Sentinel-1\\n(in yellow; DLR, 2021), which were already available on\\n15=16 July, detected significantly too less flood areas. The\\ntwo versions of CEMS (2021, from 19 July and in a postprocessed\\nversion from 11 August; both in red) are similar\\ncompared to our results (in blue), but these products also\\nfailed to detect all inundation areas in detail. A limitation\\nof our technique is that areas, for which no photos or video\\nsequences were available, may have flaws. In addition, our\\nareas are defined by inundation area polygons and are thus\\nnot street-level accurate. In contrast, the EMSR model has a\\nmuch higher level of detail down to the street level. Despite\\nthe lack of high quality satellite data and the exclusive use\\nof social media imagery and early Sentinel satellite imagery,\\nour inundation areas, which were created within 2 d, stands\\nup to long-term assessments in terms of quality.\\n4.2 Rapid loss estimation and further loss statistics\\nBased on the rapid quantification of the mapped inundation\\nareas (Sect. 4.1), a first loss estimation was carried out\\nimmediately after the flood (within 1 week; Schäfer et al.,\\n2021) using the loss models (Sect. 4.2) available in CEDIM.\\nThe modeling was applied to the whole of Germany; damage\\nproportion for Saxony and Bavaria, however, was only\\nabout 1 %. Damage was estimated to (a) damage to private\\nassets (including household goods), EUR 4.4 to 13.0 billion;\\n(b) damage to commercial, industrial, and other buildings,\\nEUR 1.8 to 3.9 billion; and (c) damage to infrastructure,\\nEUR 4.7 to 12 billion (each based on capital stock portions).\\nThis results in total estimated damage of EUR 11 to 29 billion\\n(as of 21 July 2021). However, it must be taken into account\\nthat the flooded areas represent only a part of the total\\naffected area, so that the extrapolation of the damaged area\\nwas associated with high uncertainty at the time.\\nShortly after a disaster occurs, there is usually considerable\\nuncertainty about the level of damage, so that such simplified\\nmethods are reasonable to provide timely loss estimations.\\nIn the case of the river Ahr, for example, this was\\nnecessary because no precise flood levels were initially available.\\nSubsequently, these assessments were continuously improved\\n– whenever new satellite products or analysis techniques\\nbecame available for enhanced damage assessment.\\nAs a result, since summer 2021, various loss assessments\\nhave been made by both policy makers and the insurance industry\\n(insurance associations, reinsurers, catastrophe modeling\\ncompany), selectively compiled in Table S2. At the end\\nof 2021, the German Insurance Association (Gesamtverband\\nder Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft, GDV) estimated insured\\nlosses for the July 2021 flood event at EUR8.2 billion\\nin Germany alone and EUR 11 billion for all affected\\ncountries (GDV, 2021). However, only about 37% to 47%\\nof residential buildings were insured against floods, making\\nthe total damage significantly higher. In addition, infrastructure\\nwas massively affected (see also Sect. 4.3).\\nThe German government estimated the total flood damage\\nat EUR 32.05 billion, with 57% of the damage attributable\\nto RP and 41.5% to NRW; the remainder is attributable to\\ndamage in Bavaria and Saxony (based on the EU solidarity\\nfund application of the German government within the\\nfinal report from March 2022; BMI, 2022). These damage\\nestimates include reconstruction costs compared to some of\\nthe damage-only estimates in Table S2. However, it must be\\ntaken into account that by the time of writing it is still unclear\\nwhat the final reconstruction costs and the associated\\ndamage costs will actually be.\\nMost reinsurance companies currently use the GDV or\\nGerman government estimations, both of which are closely\\naligned (depending on the exact definitions). Based on our\\nnatural hazard database CATDAT (Sect. 4.2), this event is\\none of the two largest events for natural hazards damage in\\nEurope in the last 43 years (after the 1980 Irpinia earthquake\\nin Italy) and one of the five largest in general. The difference\\nbetween book value damage, replacement costs, and reconstruction\\ncosts has yet to be determined and will likely be\\nidentified by follow-up analyses, meaning that the final economic\\ndamage value for comparison with other past disasters\\nis not known at this point.\\n4.3 Affected rail and road infrastructure\\nThe flood hit both the federal states of NRW and RP heavily\\nconcerning the transport and traffic sectors (cf. Koks et al.,\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023 Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n542 S. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1\\n2022; Szymczak et al., 2022), both of which are classified as\\ncritical infrastructures. Most of the disruptions regarding rail\\nand road occurred directly after the event. In the Ahr valley\\nalone, an estimated 103 bridges were damaged or completely\\ndestroyed (cf. BMI, 2022). On 15 July 2021, 4% of the total\\nroad traffic reports issued by the police in RP and NRW\\n(Sect. 2.5) were directly related to the flood event. Given the\\nlarge size of the two states and a generally high number of\\ntraffic reports, and since this does not include indirect effects\\nsuch as traffic jams, this can be considered a high percentage.\\nIn total, 39 road sections and 33 rail lines were affected.\\nThis decreased to 1.5% on 23 July (15 rail lines, 15 road sections),\\nbut changed little until 31 July (11 rail lines, 11 road\\nsections). At the end of August 2021, 1% of total traffic reports\\nissued in the two federal states was related to the flood\\nevent. The number of disruptions in rail traffic decreased only\\nmarginally until the end of September, while in road traffic\\nthere were only two reports related to the flood. The fact that\\nthere were still significantly more rail than road disruptions\\nremaining in fall suggests that repairing rail infrastructure is\\nmore time-consuming than repairing road infrastructure. In\\nNRW alone, around 600 km of railroad tracks were affected\\n(Deutsche Bahn, 2021). When comparing traffic affected by\\nthe July 2021 flood with the situation of past flood events,\\nfor example the 2013 European floods (Thieken et al., 2016),\\nthe total number of disruptions for both rail and road traffic\\nwas much lower in 2021. This is likely due to the rather\\nlocal scale of the flood event in 2021 as compared to 2013,\\nwhere the flood affected a major part of eastern Germany.\\nAbout twice as many districts were affected by rail disruptions\\nas compared to road disruptions (see Fig. S8a). One\\npossible explanation is that disruptions in train connections\\nusually affect a longer section of track, while disruptions on\\nthe road affect shorter segments. Figure S8b shows that longterm\\ndisruptions (> 25 d, equaling to 22%of the total disruptions)\\nmainly affected rail infrastructure (blue) in comparison\\nto road infrastructure (yellow; as of mid-October 2021).\\nRegional trains (i.e., Regionalbahn, RB; Regional-Express,\\nRE; S-Bahn, S) were especially affected by long-term damage,\\nwhereas on the road especially the highways A1 and\\nA61 were impacted. In mid-October 2021, 30 km of highways\\nwere still completely blocked, which equals 23%of the\\nroads blocked directly after the flooding (Schmitz, 2021). Regarding\\nrail infrastructure, experts struggle to give an estimation\\non how long the reconstruction will take. In November,\\nDB issued an update on the post-flood reconstruction work\\n(SPIEGEL, 2021). First important connecting lines, e.g., on\\nthe Ahr valley railroad (Ahrtalbahn) have already been reopened;\\nhowever, the reconstruction of further sections may\\ntake several years (cf. Szymczak et al., 2022).\\n5 Synopsis\\nThe severe July 2021 flood with more than 180 fatalities was\\nthe result of the superposition and interaction of different\\nmechanisms and processes on a wide range of temporal and\\nspatial scales. In the four weeks before the flood, the region\\nof main interest was affected by a high number of rain events,\\nleading to moderate soil moisture conditions and thus limited\\ninfiltration capacity (see Fig. 12). During a similar period,\\npersistent atmospheric blocking with corresponding high solar\\ninsulation over the Baltic Sea resulted in unusual high\\nSST anomalies of up to 8K compared to the climatological\\nmean. This allowed considerable amounts of water to evaporate,\\nwhich served as a major moisture source for the precipitation.\\nAccording to our trajectory analysis, the easterly\\nflow on the northern flank of the low-pressure system Bernd\\ntransported these moist air masses to the affected region.\\nTwo days before the flood, on 12 July, a quasi-stationary\\nanticyclone located over northeastern Europe blocked the\\nupper-level trough associated with the low pressure system\\nBernd. As a result, Bernd and the associated frontal system\\nmoved very slowly westward toward the region of main interest.\\nA slow propagating low with high moisture loading\\noften results in localized large rain accumulations. At least\\n2 d ahead of the flood, the specific synoptic setting and the\\nresulting rain fields were predicted well (within the range\\nof the observations) by the operational deterministic (ICONEU)\\nand the ensemble (ECMWF) model runs. ECMWF’s extreme\\nforecast index (EFI) indicated a very high occurrence\\nprobability of an extreme event (Fig. 12).\\nBecause of Bernd’s slow propagation and a rain field orientation\\nnearly parallel to the propagation direction, high rain\\ntotals starting in the early morning hours on 14 July affected\\na large area during approximately 15 h (Fig. 12). In addition,\\nembedded convection further intensified the predominantly\\nstratiform precipitation on the local-scale. According to our\\nextreme value statistics, the observed totals of up to 150mm\\ncorrespond to return periods of more than 500 years. Combined\\nwith the steep slopes of the Ahr and other river valleys\\nin the region and the almost saturated soils, the rainfall supported\\nrapid rainfall-runoff transformation by overland flow\\nthrough infiltration and saturation excess.\\nBecause of heavy rain lasting several hours over an extended\\narea, the water levels in the headwaters that originate\\nfrom the central Eifel plateau (Ahr, Kyll, and Prüm rivers)\\nrose very rapidly to unprecedented heights on 14 and 15 July\\n(Fig. 12). All peak values were clearly beyond the peak discharges\\nof a 100-year flood event, at some gauges even by a\\nfactor of more than five. At the downstream gauges, peak water\\nlevels were reached some hours later, in the early morning\\nof 15 July, but with an even more dramatic increase. Estimated\\npeak flows were all clearly above the statisticalHQ100\\nvalues, with a record factor of around seven at the gauge\\nBliesheim (Erft).

More details see text.\\ning very little floodplains for safe inundation, the villages\\nalong the river Ahr were most affected by the flood. Comparably\\ndramatic rises and peak flows, however, were also reported\\neast of the Rhine (Wupper river basin), and for several\\nrivers in Belgium and Luxembourg, where rainfall amounts\\nclose to 200mm in 24 h were observed.\\nThe magnitude of the flood not only rendered flood reduction\\nby reservoir operation impossible, it even posed a great\\nthreat to many retention basins in the region most affected. At\\nretention basin Horchheim (river Erft), for example, the peak\\ninflow was estimated to be about four times higher than the\\nstatistical HQ10 000. Although all floodgates were opened,\\nthe dam still overflowed, causing severe damage to all service\\ninfrastructure and partial destruction of the dam by backward\\nerosion. Similar situations were observed at several other retention\\nbasins.\\nVarious local-scale hydro-morphodynamic processes that\\ncondition the valley response to the flood, changes in the\\nvalley morphology, and sediment and debris transport contributed\\nto the extraordinary water levels in some regions.\\nHillslope denudation and widespread landslides observed in\\nsome areas yielded an excess of sediment in the river channels\\nnetwork, which in turn contributed to changes in morphology.\\nFlood levels increased in response to extra resistance\\nto the flow and because of partial or complete blocking\\nof cross-sections available to the flow. Other effects relevant\\nfor the high flood levels are anthropogenic morphology\\nchanges in the river cross-section attributable to railroad\\nbridges (increased bottleneck effect) and probable damming\\nand clogging of the river cross-sections at the bridges attributable\\nto the trapping of debris transported from the upstream\\nvalley. Further, it can be assumed that a larger number\\nof assets and industrial components caused a higher volume\\nof debris available for recruitment in the upstream valley. All\\nthese effects, observed at several locations, may explain why\\nthe maximum water level of the 2021 flood at several sites\\nwas higher (e.g., Dernau by 2.4 m) compared to the 1804\\nflood, although the estimated peak flood discharges were in\\nthe same order of magnitude.\\nAs part of CEDIM’s FDA task force, we started to systematically\\nassess inundation areas almost for the entire Ahr\\ncatchment on 14 July, while the flooding was still ongoing\\n(Fig. 12). Rapid remote sensing of the inundation area is an\\nessential component for estimating the impact of a disaster\\nand for early response management to prioritize emergency\\nresponse. For the analyses, live imagery from helicopters or\\ndrones and social media (e.g., YouTube, Twitter) were manually\\ncollected and processed. From 15=16 July, Sentinel-1\\nimagery and first analyses of automatic procedures by DLR\\nwere available and integrated into the analyses to identify\\nfurther flooded areas. From 17 July, Sentinel-2 imagery was\\nused to identify further flooded areas despite partial cloud\\ncover. On 18 July, the first final version of estimated inundation\\nareas was available. A qualitative comparison with other\\nproducts of inundation areas (e.g., EMSR517_v3, CEMS,\\n2021; SGD, 2021) is at a similar level to our near-real-time\\nestimation.\\nIn the Ahr valley alone, more than 100 bridges were damaged\\nor completely destroyed. On 15 July 2021, about 4%\\nof the total road traffic reports issued by the police in RP\\nand NRW were directly related to the flood event. In NRW,\\naround 600 km of railroad tracks were affected. In general,\\nabout twice as many districts suffered from by rail disruptions\\n– with longer required reconstruction times compared\\nto road disruptions. Based on the rapid quantification of the\\nmapped inundation areas, we carried out a first loss estimation\\nusing CEDIM’s loss model 1 week after the onset\\nof the flood (Fig. 12). Damage to private assets was estimated\\nbetween EUR 4.4 and 13.0 billion, damage to commercial,\\nindustrial, and other buildings between EUR 1.8 and\\n3.9 billion, and damage to infrastructure between EUR 4.7\\nand 12 billion, thus in total EUR 11 to 29 billion. Several\\nmonths later, the German government applied to the European\\nCommission for a financial contribution from the Euhttps://\\ndoi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023 Nat. Hazards Earth Syst.

The amount is thus at the upper end of our nearreal-\\ntime estimations.\\n6 Discussion and conclusions\\nThe July 2021 flood in western Germany and neighboring\\nregions was one of the five most severe and expensive catastrophes\\nrelated to natural hazards in Europe in the last half\\ncentury. More than 180 people lost their lives, and well over\\n10 000 buildings were damaged. Numerous critical infrastructures,\\nsuch as power and water supply networks, bridges,\\nrailway tracks, and roads, were partly or completely destroyed,\\nwhich significantly hampered relief deliveries and\\nclean-up work in the affected area. According to estimates\\nfrom the German government in March 2022, the total damage\\nin Germany alone amounts to EUR 32 billion (BMI,\\n2022), although it is still unclear how high the final reconstruction\\ncosts will actually be.\\nAs part of CEDIM’s Forensic Disaster Analyses (FDAs)\\nin near-real-time, an interdisciplinary team of scientists investigated\\nthis severe flood event from different perspectives.\\nBased upon analyses of available model and observational\\ndata and supplemented by own simulations and assessments,\\nthis paper has examined the complex interactions among meteorological,\\nhydrological, hydraulic, and geomorphological\\nprocesses and mechanisms that led to the extraordinary flood.\\nAnother objective of this study was to demonstrate how additional\\ninformation immediately after a disaster can generate\\nadded value for early response management (e.g., prioritization\\nof emergency measures), and how helpful these first assessments\\ncan be. Some of the analyses presented here were\\nconducted while the flood was still ongoing – such as the\\nestimation of inundation areas from photographs, video sequences,\\nand satellite overflights, and derived damage assessments.\\nFurthermore, we estimated the impact in terms of traffic\\ndisruptions and economic losses. Not only was the flood’s\\nintensity decisive in the outcomes, but also the failure of the\\nwarning chain (Fekete and Sandholz, 2021; Thieken et al.,\\n2022; DKKV, 2022). The population was informed too late\\nor insufficiently about the extent of the imminent disaster despite\\nthe fact that both deterministic and ensemble weather\\nforecasts issued, for example by DWD and ECMWF, predicted\\nextreme rain totals and signified the potential of a very\\nunusual or extreme event at least 2 d before the flood.\\nBased upon our analyses, we draw the following conclusions\\nand make some recommendations to improve the estimation\\nof flood hazard and risk:\\n– Catastrophic events such as the July 2021 flood occur\\nvery rarely, mainly because the relevant processes and\\nmechanisms on different spatial and temporal scales\\nthat amplify such an event must interact optimally.\\nHowever, as such very rare events are responsible for\\nthe greatest number of fatalities and the highest economic\\nlosses, our still insufficient knowledge need to be\\nfurther improved across disciplines through more dedicated\\nresearch.\\n– In recent years, the forecasting skill of numerical\\nweather models has improved significantly due to increasing\\ncomputational power, better observations and\\nassimilation schemes, advanced model physics, higher\\nresolution, and larger ensembles (Bauer et al., 2015).\\nWhile the meteorological potential for an extraordinary\\nevent in the region was identified in the DWD and\\nECMWF forecasts at least 2 d in advance, it remains\\ndifficult to communicate the probabilistic nature of forecasts,\\nin particular with respect to extremes, to users and\\nthe general public. Here, we have used the EFI based on\\nECMWF forecasts as a simple and intuitive metric that\\nsuccessfully gave indications for a potentially harmful\\nevent already several days before it occurred. We advertise\\nusage of such concepts for other cases and forecasting\\nsystems to facilitate communication. However,\\na robust assessment of the model climate and predicted\\nextremes as a reference is necessary to compute the\\nEFI, which requires expensive re-forecasts. Currently,\\nECMWF is one of few operational centers internationally\\nthat provides such a metric operationally.\\n– River gauges are a crucial source of information in the\\nevent of a flood. These gauges should be installed in\\nsuch a way that they also function reliably in the event\\nof an extreme flood. Therefore, particular care should\\nbe taken when replacing the river gauges lost during the\\nrecent flood to avoid similar issues in the future. The\\nuse of video analysis can be an alternative, allowing distance\\nobservation of flood levels and inference of flood\\ndischarges with fairly good results (Detert et al., 2017).\\n– The flood hazard (e.g., a 100-year flood level) typically\\nused as a design basis for flood protection is currently\\nunderestimated when historical severe floods are\\nnot considered (cf. Roggenkamp and Hergert, 2022). In\\nthe case of the Ahr catchment, historical analyses have\\nshown that events comparable to the July 2021 flood had\\noccurred already in 1804 and 1910, but only data from\\nthe continuous records (e.g., for gauge Altenahr starting\\nin 1946) were used to estimate HQ100 values. Furthermore,\\nwhen analyzing and interpreting hydrological\\ndata, it is important to consider that infrastructures,\\nlandscape occupation, and flood protection measures often\\nchange considerably with direct consequences on\\nflood risk over timescales shorter than the return period\\nconsidered for flood emergency management.\\n– By interacting with the landscape and network morphology\\nof river channels, flowing water enhances a flood’s\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\nS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 flood event – Part 1 545\\ndestructive power. Relevant effects include (a) the\\noccurrence of extreme landscape erosion, including\\nrapidly developing rivulets and landslides; (b) rapidly\\nevolving erosion and scour processes in the channel network\\nand urban space; (c) recruitment of large-scale debris\\nfrom the natural landscape and urban landscape;\\n(d) deposition and clogging of bottlenecks in the channel\\nnetwork with eventual collapse; (e) possible intersection\\nof the flow with landscape anthropogenic or natural\\nsingularities; and (f) interaction with vegetation.\\nNone of these aspects are considered in the current practice\\nof flood hazard modeling, which leads to an underestimation\\nof the actual risk (cf. also Dietze et al., 2022).\\nWe suggest an update of the floods directive, which\\nshould require that flood hazard and risk assessments\\ninclude a heuristic hydro-morphodynamic approach that\\nconsiders the landscape and network of river channels,\\nincluding sediment transport and morphology changes\\n(Nones, 2019).\\n– The near-real-time analyses carried out within the frame\\nof CEDIM’s FDA task force (Schäfer et al., 2021)\\ndemonstrated that it is possible to meaningfully identify\\na large part of the flooded area from rapidly available\\nground data (photos, video sequences) in near-real-time\\nduring or after an event and thus generate valuable information\\nfor disaster management. A systematic flyover\\nof the affected areas using drones or similar – as is\\ncurrently being developed as part of a DLR pilot project\\n(DLR, 2022) – would be highly desirable. Such results,\\nmade available to authorities or relevant stakeholders,\\ncan help to get a quick and better overview of the overall\\nsituation in order to assess the damage more quickly and\\nto respond more appropriately in the aftermath of catastrophic\\nevents. This helps to mitigate associated adverse\\neffects.\\n– The impacts of extreme hydro-meteorological events\\nalso depend upon the way both authorities and individuals\\nrespond to predicted extremes and whether they take\\nappropriate action (e.g., securing valuable assets and\\ncritical infrastructure, evacuations). Operational hydrological\\nforecasts in Germany, however, currently mainly\\nonly provide forecasts of streamflow and water levels at\\ngauges. To be as prepared as possible for upcoming extreme\\nevents, accurate predictions of both their physical\\ncharacteristics and expected impacts on society and\\nthe built and natural environment are essential (Taylor\\net al., 2018; Merz et al., 2020; WMO, 2020). Impactbased\\nforecasting that incorporates exposure, vulnerability,\\nand social systems in addition to the hazard has\\ngreat potential to reduce damage and increase resilience\\nsubstantially. The feasibility of this has recently been\\ndemonstrated by Apel et al. (2022), who used a simplified\\nhydrodynamic flood model to retroactively incorporate\\nspatially explicit information (such as inundation\\narea, depths, and flow velocities) based on predicted\\ngauge discharges or water levels into current hydrological\\nforecasting systems for the July 2021 flood.\\nThis provides real-time information on the expected extent\\nof flooding and its impacts. By implementing the\\nmodel on graphical processing units, simulation times\\nare within the range required for operational flood warning.\\nPART2 of the paper (Ludwig et al., 2022) puts the\\nJuly 2021 flood in historical context. This is accomplished\\nnot only by statistical analysis of observational data, but\\nalso by incorporating a large ensemble of regional climate\\nsimulations (comprising 12 000 years; cf. Ehmele et al.,\\n2020, 2022). The second focus of PART2 is to examine how\\nthe precipitation causing the flood event could unfold in the\\ncontext of climate change. The related analysis is based on\\na storyline approach using a series of pseudo global warming\\nexperiments and on a conventional ensemble of future\\nclimate projections.\\nCode and data availability.
