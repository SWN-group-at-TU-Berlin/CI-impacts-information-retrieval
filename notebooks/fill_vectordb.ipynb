      "In mid-July 2021, a persistent low-pressure system caused\n",
      "extreme precipitation in parts of the Belgian, German and\n",
      "Dutch catchments of the Meuse and Rhine rivers. This led\n",
      "to record-breaking water levels and severe ﬂooding (Mohr\n",
      "et al., 2022). Comparable heavy precipitation events in this\n",
      "area have never been registered in most of the affected areas\n",
      "before (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). The German states most af-\n",
      "fected include Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz), with\n",

Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were hit\\nby extreme precipitation and ﬂooding in July 2021. This\\nbrief communication provides an overview of the impacts to\\nlarge-scale critical infrastructure systems and how recovery\\nhas progressed. The results show that Germany and Belgium\\nwere particularly affected, with many infrastructure assets\\nseverely damaged or completely destroyed. Impacts range\\nfrom completely destroyed bridges and sewage systems, to\\nseverely damaged schools and hospitals. We ﬁnd that (large-\\nscale) risk assessments, often focused on larger (river) ﬂood\\nevents, do not ﬁnd these local, but severe, impacts due to crit-\\nical infrastructure failures. This may be the result of limited\\navailability of validation material. As such, this brief com-\\nmunication not only will help to better understand how criti-\\ncal infrastructure can be affected by ﬂooding, but also can be\\nused as validation material for future ﬂood risk assessments.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nIn mid-July 2021, a persistent low-pressure system caused\\nextreme precipitation in parts of the Belgian, German and\\nDutch catchments of the Meuse and Rhine rivers. This led\\nto record-breaking water levels and severe ﬂooding (Mohr\\net al., 2022). Comparable heavy precipitation events in this\\narea have never been registered in most of the affected areas\\nbefore (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). The German states most af-\\nfected include Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz), with\\ndamage to the Ahr River valley (Ahrtal), several regions in\\n\\nthe Eiffel National Park, to the city of Trier. Flooding in\\nBelgium was concentrated in the Vesdre River valley (dis-\\ntricts of Pepinster, Ensival and Verviers), the Meuse River\\nvalley (Maaseik, Liége), the Gete River valley (Herk-de-Stad\\nand Halen) and southeast Brussels (Wavre). The Netherlands\\nexperienced ﬂooding, mostly concentrated in the southern\\ndistrict of Limburg. In total, at least 220 casualties have\\nbeen reported, with insured loss estimates of approximately\\nEUR 150 million–EUR 250 million in the Netherlands (Ver-\\nbond voor Verzekeraars, 2022), ∼ EUR 2.2 billion in Bel-\\ngium (Assuralia, 2022) and ∼ EUR 8.2 billion (GDV, 2022)\\nin Germany. The event caused major damages to residential\\nand commercial structures and to many critical infrastruc-\\nture (CI) assets. Not only vital functions for ﬁrst responders\\nwere affected (e.g. hospitals, ﬁre departments), but also rail-\\nways, bridges and utility networks (e.g. water and electricity\\nsupply) were severely damaged, expecting to take months to\\nyears to fully rebuild.\\n\\nCI is often considered to be the backbone of a well-\\nfunctioning society (Hall et al., 2016), which is particularly\\neminent during natural hazards and disasters. For instance,\\nfailure of electricity or telecommunication services immedi-\\nately causes disruptions in the day-to-day functioning of peo-\\nple and businesses, including those outside the directly af-\\nfected area. Despite the (academic) agreement that failure of\\ninfrastructure systems may cause (large-scale) societal dis-\\nruptions (Garschagen and Sandholz, 2018; Hallegatte et al.,\\n2019; Fekete and Sandholz, 2021), empirical evidence on the\\nimpacts of extreme weather events on these systems is still\\n\\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\\n\\n\\x0c3832\\n\\nE.

This brief communication provides an overview of\\nthe observed ﬂood impacts to large-scale infrastructure sys-\\ntems during the 2021 mid-July western European ﬂood event\\nand how reconstruction of these large-scale systems has pro-\\ngressed. Next, we highlight how some of these observations\\ncompare to academic modelling approaches. We conclude\\nwith suggestions on moving forward in CI risk modelling,\\nbased on the lessons learned from this extreme event.\\n\\n2 Critical infrastructure impacts\\n\\n2.1 Transport infrastructure\\n\\nIn Germany, road and railway infrastructure was severely\\ndamaged as documented exemplarily in Fig. 1. Cost esti-\\nmates reach up to EURO 2 billion Euro (MDR, 2021). More\\nthan 130 km of motorways were closed directly after the\\nevent, of which 50 km were still closed two months later,\\nwith an estimated repair cost of EUR 100 million (Hauser,\\n2021). Of the 112 bridges in the ﬂooded 40 km of the Ahr\\nvalley (Rhineland-Palatinate), 62 bridges were destroyed,\\n13 were severely damaged and only 35 were in operation\\na month after the ﬂood event (MDR, 2021). Over 74 km\\nof roads, paths and bridges in the Ahr valley have been\\n(critically) damaged. In some cases, repairs are expected to\\ntake months to years (Zeit Online, 2021). For example, ma-\\njor freeway sections, including parts of the A1 motorway,\\nwere closed until early 2022 (24Rhein, 2022). In addition,\\nabout 50 000 cars were damaged, causing insurance claims of\\nsome EUR 450 million (ADAC, 2021). The German railway\\nprovider Deutsche Bahn expects asset damages of around\\nEUR 1.3 billion. Among other things, 180 level crossings,\\nalmost 40 signal boxes, over 1000 catenary and signal masts,\\nand 600 km of tracks were destroyed, as well as energy sup-\\nply systems, elevators and lighting systems (MDR, 2021).\\nAs of 11 April 2022, 14 of the affected rail stretches are\\nfully functional again. The less damaged stretches were func-\\ntional again within 3 months, while some of the most dam-\\naged sections in the Ahr valley are expected to be ﬁnished\\nby the end of 2025 (DB, 2022). In Belgium, approximately\\n10 km of railway tracks and 3000 sleeper tracks have to be re-\\nplaced; 50 km of catenary needs to be repaired; and 70 000 t\\nof railway track bed needs to be placed, with estimated\\ncosts between EUR 30 million–EUR 50 million (Rozendaal,\\n2021a). Most damages have been repaired within 2 weeks.\\nThe most severely damaged railway line (between the vil-\\nlages of Spa and Pepinster) was reopened again on 3 Octo-\\nber 2021 (Rozendaal, 2021b). In the Netherlands, no large-\\nscale damage has been reported to transport infrastructure. A\\nfew national highways were partly ﬂooded (e.g. the A76 in\\nboth directions) or brieﬂy closed (< 3 d) because of the po-\\ntential of ﬂooding. Most likely due to relative low-ﬂow ve-\\nlocities, damage to Dutch national road infrastructure was\\nlimited. Several railway sections were closed (e.g. the rail-\\n\\nway section between Maastricht and Liége) and some dam-\\nage occurred to the railway infrastructure, in particular to the\\nelectronic “track circuit” devices and saturated railway em-\\nbankments (Prorail, 2021).\\n\\n2.2 Electricity and gas supply\\n\\nAt the peak of the event, around 200 000 people experienced\\npower outages in Germany. Electricity infrastructure was\\nseverely damaged in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-\\nPalatinate. However, within 2 d around 50 % of the power\\nwas restored through repairs and temporary ﬁxes. Within 8\\nweeks, no emergency power generators were required any-\\nmore, with most of the power infrastructure restored in Ger-\\nmany’s affected areas. Some areas, however, only had perma-\\nnent power infrastructure after 6 months (Westnetz, 2022).\\nThe gas distribution network in the Ahr valley was severely\\ndamaged. Approximately 133 km of natural gas pipelines,\\n8500 gas metres, 3400 house pressure regulators, 7220 of the\\napproximately 8000 household connections, and 31 systems\\nmeasuring and regulating gas pressure have been damaged\\nor destroyed (SWR, 2021). Gas supply was almost fully re-\\nstored within 4.5 months after the ﬂood event (Energienetze\\nMittelrhein, 2021). In Belgium, approximately 41 500 peo-\\nple experienced power outages at the peak of the event. This\\nwas the result of both damaged and deliberately switched-\\noff electrical cabinets to prevent serious damages. It took\\naround 3 weeks to fully restore power. Similar to Germany,\\nsevere damage had been observed to the gas network. In the\\nvillages around Liége, such as Chaudfontaine and Pepinster\\n(Belgium), gas supply was fully recovered within 5 months\\n(Grosjean, 2021; De Wolf, 2021). In the Netherlands, 1000–\\n2000 households experienced a loss of electricity supply at\\nthe peak of the event. Between 100 to 200 households had\\nno gas supply. Within several days, electricity supply was re-\\nstored (Task Force Fact Finding Hoogwater, 2021).\\n\\n2.3 Drinking water supply and wastewater\\n\\nIn the region of Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), most drink-\\ning water supply was restored within 2 months (Hochwasser\\nAhr, 2021a). However, sewage treatment plants in Alte-\\nnahr, Mayschoss and Sinzig had been largely destroyed\\n(Hochwasser Ahr, 2021b), and it is expected to take at least\\n1.5 years to fully repair most sewage treatment plants. Emer-\\ngency sewage treatment plants have been built in the mean-\\ntime (GA, 2021). In the Erft region 7 out of 31 wastewater\\nfacilities had been destroyed. Many facilities reported pollu-\\ntion of oil and diesel, forming layers up to 15 cm thick (Kuhn,\\n2021). In addition, much of the groundwater (and soil) in\\nthe ﬂood region was mixed with oil (from destroyed residen-\\ntial oil tanks), chemicals such as fertilizers (from wineries\\nand other agriculture) and chemicals from nearby industrial\\nplants. In Sinzig, 3.6 × 106 L of oil–water mixture was re-\\ncycled, gaining 3600 m3 of oil, to be reused for heating and\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

In the heavily destroyed town\\nof Bad Münstereifel (in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia),\\ndrinking water supply was re-established within 5 d after the\\nﬂood event (most frequently through emergency tanks), and\\nabout 50 % of the city centre was reconnected to the fresh-\\nwater network shortly thereafter however, water had to be\\nboiled before consumption until about 1 month later (Bad\\nMünstereifel, 2021). In Belgium, several towns experienced\\ndisruptions in water supply (in particular as a result of pol-\\nlution). Directly after the event, approximately 3400 families\\nhad no access to potable water. Within less than a week, this\\nwas reduced to around 1650 families (Terzake, 2021). It took,\\nhowever, 6 months to rebuild the permanent water supply in-\\nfrastructure (SWDE, 2022). In the Netherlands, little to no\\nproblems have been recorded with regards to water supply.\\n\\n2.4 Solid waste\\n\\nWe found no information regarding direct impact on solid-\\nwaste facilities as a result of the ﬂood event. However, there\\nis a large pressure on the solid-waste sector to clean the af-\\nfected areas; 1 month after the event, we observed dozens\\nof large temporary waste ﬁlls and frequent incidences of\\noil pollution in Rhineland-Palatinate during a ﬁeld visit.\\nIn the Ahrweiler district alone, the ﬂood caused as much\\nsolid waste as normally would be collected over 30 years.\\nIn Belgium, the amount of solid waste is estimated around\\n160 000 t, stored at several places, such as the abandoned\\nhighway track A601. This highway has been used for approx-\\nimately 9 months as a temporary storage for debris (Cou-\\nplez, 2022). In the Netherlands, there have been primarily\\nproblems with waste deposits along the river banks, which\\nis mostly the solid waste transported by the river from fur-\\nther upstream. Thousands of tonnes of tree debris (logs and\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3831-2022\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3831–3838, 2022\\n\\n\\x0c3834\\n\\nE. E. Koks et al.: Flood impacts to infrastructure\\n\\nof running water and electricity (Ärzte Zeitung, 2021). Af-\\nter 1.5 months, medical care was guaranteed again in the\\nmost affected regions in Rhineland-Palatinate (Hochwasser\\nAhr, 2021c). In the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, approx-\\nimately 68 hospitals have been affected, of which several\\nhave been affected severely and will take at least 1.5 years\\nto be rebuilt (Fig. 2). Direct damages are estimated to be\\nat least EUR 100 million to repair all medical facilities (Ko-\\nrzilius, 2021). In the town of Eschweiler (Germany), for ex-\\nample, the basement of the hospital was ﬂooded, as well as\\nthe outbuildings and the entire outdoor area. The power sup-\\nply collapsed, the entire building technology was destroyed\\nand some 300 patients had to be evacuated by helicopter.\\nProperty damage is expected to be around EUR 50 million.\\nWithin 3.5 weeks, the hospital was partly operational, and\\nwithin 3 months, all hospital operations continued normally\\n(SAH Eschweiler, 2021). The Mutterhaus Ehrang hospital in\\nTrier (Germany) is now permanently closed as the hospital is\\ntoo severely damaged to rebuild. Furthermore, in the region\\nof Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), 19 daycare centres and\\n17 schools suffered damage from the ﬂoods, affecting more\\nthan 8000 students (Staib, 2021). Approximately 4 months\\nafter the ﬂood event, the district of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler\\nestablished emergency educational facilities using 297 con-\\ntainers that serve as classrooms, ofﬁces and dining facilities\\nfor more than 800 students (Wiesbadener Kurier, 2021). In\\nBelgium, various rural clinics have been affected and were\\nunable to provide any services. Concurrently, in the most af-\\nfected areas, general-practitioner facilities have been com-\\npletely destroyed (Le Spécialiste, 2021). In the Netherlands,\\none nursing home was ﬂooded, and one hospital was evacu-\\nated as a precautionary measure.\\n\\n3 Have research studies already “reﬂected” such\\n\\nimpacts?\\n\\nMost often, large-scale object-based infrastructure impact\\nstudies (e.g. Bubeck et al., 2019) only disclose aggregated\\nrisk metrics (i.e. country-level risk estimates), which ham-\\npers veriﬁcation and validation with observed impacts on\\nsmaller scales. Van Ginkel et al. (2021) assessed river ﬂood\\nrisk for all road segments in Europe. Of the eight motorway\\nﬂoods incidents in Germany reported by Hauser (2021), three\\nare recognizable as ﬂood hotspots in van Ginkel et al. (2021).\\nDuring the event in 2021, most damage was caused by rel-\\natively small rivers which are only represented in the haz-\\nard data from the point that the upstream catchment is above\\n500 km2. For example, the Ahr valley is partly covered (400\\nof the 900 km2) by van Ginkel et al., 2021, who estimate the\\nroad repair costs at EUR 4 million to EUR 29 million (under\\nlow- and high-ﬂow velocities respectively.) for a 1 : 500 year\\nevent. The ﬁeld visit showed damage caused by high-ﬂow\\nvelocities at multiple places, and video footage of the events\\nsuggests these are locally more towards 2 m s−1, which van\\n\\nFigure 2.

For instance, the\\ntowns of Höenningen and Mayschoss, served as major recy-\\ncle hubs. Per day, approximately 500 t of wood debris was\\ntransported, cut, chipped and recycled into ﬁrewood, which\\ncontinued for at least 6 weeks after the ﬂood (Gather, 2021).\\n\\n2.5 Telecommunication\\n\\nIn Germany, all severely affected areas experienced dis-\\nruption of mobile network services. Within the region of\\nRhineland-Palatinate, it took 2 weeks to ensure 100 % cover-\\nage again through emergency communication masts. Within\\n1 month, most of the network was restored to pre-disaster ser-\\nvice provision. After 5 months, broadband has also been re-\\nstored in the most affected areas, which started in most areas\\nonly after power infrastructure was rebuilt (Westnetz, 2021).\\nIn Belgium, it has taken around 11 months to restore connec-\\ntion to the last communities within the affected area. In the\\nNetherlands, approximately 7000 households were affected\\nby disrupted telecommunication service. This was primarily\\ndue to ﬂooded telecommunication infrastructure in the direct\\nvicinity of ﬂooded houses. However, some distribution cab-\\ninets were ﬂooded as well, with the largest ﬂooded cabinet\\naffecting around 700 households. Due to damaged bridges,\\nseveral ﬁbre cables were damaged. Five telecommunication\\nmasts were affected as well, but “tuning” of the network\\nensured that the service disruption was kept to a minimum\\n(Task Force Fact Finding Hoogwater, 2021).\\n\\n2.6 Healthcare and education\\n\\nIn Germany, an estimated 180 general-practitioner practices\\nhave been affected by the ﬂood event.

Koks et al.: Flood impacts to infrastructure\\n\\n3835\\n\\nGinkel et al. (2021) considered “high-ﬂow velocity”, than\\ntowards 0.2 m s−1, which they considered “low-ﬂow veloc-\\nity”. At ﬁrst sight, the spatial extent of the exposed assets\\nhas reasonable correspondence to the model of van Ginkel\\net al. (2021). However, the model ignores bridge damage,\\nwhich in reality was a major source of damage (Sect. 2.1).\\nAlso, a signiﬁcant share of observed damage resulted from\\npluvial ﬂooding, ﬂash ﬂooding and landslides which was not\\ncaptured by van Ginkel et al. (2021).\\n\\nReconnaissance observations (August 2021) along the\\nrivers Ahr and Erft (Lemnitzer et al., 2022) documented se-\\nvere, as well as irreparable, damage to bridges designed and\\nconstructed within the last 2 decades and total destruction of\\nalmost all historical bridges, typically constructed on shallow\\nfoundations. Historical bridge designs concentrated primar-\\nily on cross-sectional requirements for expected water vol-\\numes. Triggered by ﬂood events in the past four decades,\\nbridge design research has broadened by focusing on risk-\\nbased scour assessment, hydrodynamic pier designs, reduc-\\ntion of intermediate bridge support elements, impact and col-\\nlision loading, implementation of bridge protection mecha-\\nnisms such as from wood debris, and machine learning ap-\\nproaches from past failures (VAW 188, 2006; Bento et al.,\\n2020; Majtan et al., 2021; Naser, 2021). Accounting for all\\nthese mechanisms, however, is complex (Haehnel and Daly,\\n2004) and no guarantee to avoid the observed failures. Var-\\nious international design codes (e.g. American bridge stan-\\ndard AASHTO, Australian bridge standard AS5100, and\\nJapanese bridge standard SHB) provide quantitative tools to\\nassess impact loading from debris/tree logs; however, bridges\\nerected prior to recent design requirements are unable to\\nmaintain global structural stability under the excessive mul-\\ntidirectional loading, such as seen in the 2021 ﬂoods. Based\\non ﬁeld observations, the advancement of erosion prevention\\npractices for ﬂood events emerged as a critical research fo-\\ncus, as the interface stability between water, soil and foun-\\ndation elements was found to be compromised at almost all\\nbridge damage locations visited.\\n\\nNext to the above insights into modelling direct physical\\ndamages, we can also use the observation from the event\\nto further improve and validate our assumptions on post-\\ndisaster (infrastructure) recovery. In particular, when mod-\\nelling the economic and societal impacts, the recovery pro-\\ncess is one of the most important drivers of losses (e.g. Koks\\net al., 2015). The July 2021 event has given us several in-\\nsights. Firstly, there is a prioritization between different in-\\nfrastructure systems. In Germany, for example, we found that\\nin several affected areas the electricity network was repaired\\nﬁrst, which was subsequently followed by the gas and broad-\\nband network. Secondly, there is a prioritization within in-\\nfrastructure systems. For example, more critical roads are re-\\npaired sooner than less critical roads. While this may sound\\nobvious, academic studies often consider a recovery of the\\nentire system, without considering a speciﬁc order of im-\\nportance. Finally, good recovery management practices and\\n\\nenough trades(wo)men (e.g. electricians, utility workers) are\\none of the most important drivers of a speedy and successful\\nrecovery. These are often not included within the modelling\\nassumptions.\\n\\n4 Moving forward\\n\\nBased on our ﬁndings, we highlight three aspects to move\\nforward in the ﬁeld of infrastructure disaster risk assess-\\nments. First, merely focusing on ﬂood extent and depth is\\nnot sufﬁcient to estimate the impacts of extreme ﬂood events\\nto infrastructure. In particular, in Germany and Belgium, it\\nbecame evident that the high discharge and streamﬂow and\\ncorresponding high-ﬂow velocities (resulting from the lo-\\ncal topography and the intensity of the rainfall) are a de-\\ncisive factor in explaining the degree of destruction. Many\\nof the observed failures such as bridge scour, road embank-\\nment instabilities and erosion of aggregate foundations could\\nlikely better be explained from ﬂow velocity rather than ﬂood\\ndepth. Future ﬂood impact studies, especially those focusing\\non transport infrastructure, should aim to account for ﬂow\\nvelocity in their impact modelling, in particular in areas with\\nsteep gradients.\\n\\nSecond, the observed impacts on CI highlight the inﬂu-\\nence of spatial scale on the magnitude of the impacts. On a\\nlocal and regional level, the disruptions in daily lives and to\\nthe economy were enormous. Yet, zoomed out on a national\\nscale, the impacts were relatively small. While large-scale\\nstudies are useful to identify potential hotspots and bottle-\\nnecks in the system, local-scale studies are essential to better\\nunderstand the real impacts (and are also better able to do so).\\nThis is true for both the consequences to infrastructure assets\\nand the services and the impacts on lives and livelihoods.\\n\\nFinally, the level of destruction and disruption caused by\\nthis event highlights the need for the development of both\\nasset and system-level adaptation measures, securing more\\nresilient infrastructure systems. Extreme weather events are\\nexpected to become more likely not only in western Europe,\\nbut also globally in an increasingly warmer world. As such,\\nthere is an urgency to investigate not only how service provi-\\nsion can be ensured in the case of an extreme event but also\\nhow the recovery process to a minimum service level can\\nbe as swift and smooth as possible. This calls for a further\\ncollaboration between the different sectors of reliability and\\nsystems engineering and disaster risk modelling and manage-\\nment. The limited number of studies on impact on CI due to\\nﬂooding highlights the need for more detailed infrastructure\\nfailure impact assessments including cascading impacts.\\n\\nData availability.

       " 'Nach der Flut\\n\\nAnhaltender Starkregen führte Mitte Juli dazu,  \\ndass sich in Nordrhein-Westfalen und Rheinland-Pfalz \\nkleine Flüsse in reißende Ströme verwandelten. \\nMeterhohe Flutwellen verwüsteten Dörfer, Städte  \\nund ganze Landstiche. Allein in Nordrhein sind  \\n145 Arztpraxen und im ganzen Land 68 Krankenhäuser \\nunterschiedlich schwer vom Hochwasser betroffen.  \\nDie Schäden dürften nach ersten Schätzungen des  \\nNRW-Gesundheitsministeriums mehr als 100 Millionen \\nEuro betragen.\\n\\nvon Heike Korzilius\\n\\nFoto: Till Erdmenger\\n\\n12 \\n\\nEs ist einer dieser trüben Sommertage, von de\\xad\\n\\nnen es in diesem Jahr so viele gab. Vor dem \\nHaupteingang  des  Marien\\xadHospitals  in \\nErftstadt\\xadLiblar  türmt  sich  der  Schutt.  Das \\nKrankenhaus  ist  geschlossen,  seit  am  Morgen  des   \\n15. Juli eine meterhohe Flutwelle des ansonsten harm\\xad\\nlosen Flüsschens Erft den ebenerdigen Komplex ver\\xad\\nwüstet hat. Nur wenige Schritte sind es von dort zum \\nangrenzenden Ärztehaus. Hier hat die radiologische \\nPraxis von Barbara Feldgen und Matthias Wolff das\\xad\\nselbe Schicksal erlitten. Jetzt, Ende August, sind der \\nSchlamm,  die  zerstörten  Möbel  und  medizinischen \\nGeräte  entsorgt.  Das  Erdgeschoss,  in  dem  sich  die \\n Praxis befand, ist entkernt und wartet auf den Wieder\\xad\\naufbau. „Putz, Estrich, es ist alles raus“, sagt Wolff. \\nZwei MRT\\xadGeräte, der Computertomograf, Röntgen\\xad\\nanlage, EDV\\xadTechnik – Totalschaden. Wichtig ist dem \\nRadiologen, dass die meisten Patientendaten gerettet \\nwerden konnten. Denn der Bildspeicher der Praxis war \\nunter der Decke an gebracht. „Mithilfe unseres IT\\xadSpe\\xad\\nzialisten konnten wir das meiste rekonstruieren“, sagt \\nWolffs Praxispartnerin Feldgen. „Aber alles aus Papier, \\nwie zum Beispiel Überweisungsscheine, ist weg.“\\n\\nDie beiden stehen zwischen schlammverschmierten \\nStyroporplatten, Schubkarren, Schuttsäcken und Stütz\\xad\\npfeilern, dort, wo vor Kurzem noch ein MRT\\xadGerät stand. \\n„Wir haben hier am Tag der Flut noch bis kurz vor zehn \\nUhr weitgehend normal gearbeitet“, sagt Wolff. „Es gab \\nzwar im Umkreis schon kein Telefon und keinen Strom \\nmehr. Das Ärztehaus hat aber eine eigene Stromversor\\xad\\ngung  und  der  Trafo  stand  noch  im  Trockenen.“  Die \\nFeuerwehr war an diesem Vormittag bereits früh auf \\ndem Gelände, um den unter Wasser stehenden Keller \\ndes Marien\\xadHospitals auszupumpen. „Irgendwann hieß \\nes, wir sollten die Autos wegfahren, das Wasser könnte \\nsteigen“, erinnert sich Feldgen. Das ist der Zeitpunkt, \\nan dem die beiden Radiologen Patienten und Mitarbei\\xad\\nterinnen nach Hause schicken. Feldgen sucht für ihr \\nAuto einen sicheren Parkplatz in der Umgebung. „Auf \\ndem Rückweg in die Praxis musste ich die Schuhe aus\\xad\\nziehen, weil das Wasser schon so hoch stand. Aber ich \\nmuss zugeben, ich habe die Situation unterschätzt.“ \\n\\nAuch Rettungswagen werden überflutet\\n\\nDann kommt die Flut. Innerhalb von Minuten wer\\xad\\nden  die  Erdgeschosse  in  Klinik  und  Praxis  über\\xad\\nschwemmt, ein Feuerwehrauto und mehrere Rettungs\\xad\\nwagen, mit denen Patienten aus dem Krankenhaus \\nevakuiert werden sollen, laufen voll mit schlammigem \\nWasser. Feldgen flüchtet sich mit mehreren Kollegin\\xad\\nnen und Kollegen aus dem Krankenhaus und einigen \\nPatienten in die kleine Kapelle – sie liegt fünf Stufen \\nhöher als der Rest des Geländes. Doch auch dort dringt \\nWasser ein. Über eine Wendeltreppe retten sich alle in \\nden ersten Stock des Nachbargebäudes, wo sie von den \\ndort lebenden Ordensfrauen betreut werden, bis Ret\\xad\\ntungskräfte mit schweren Lastwagen die vom Wasser \\nEingeschlossenen bergen können. \\n\\nRheinisches Ärzteblatt / Heft 10 / 2021\\n\\nThema\\x0cDie Hilfsbereitschaft ist überwältigend\\n\\nMan merkt Wolff und Feldgen an, dass die Ereignis\\xad\\nse vom 15. Juli ihre Spuren hinterlassen haben, nicht \\nnur in der Praxis. Dennoch strahlen beide Tatkraft und \\nZuversicht aus. Denn für die Radiologen steht fest, dass \\nsie ihre Arbeit so schnell wie möglich wieder aufneh\\xad\\nmen wollen. 3.500 Patientinnen und Patienten versor\\xad\\ngen sie und ihr Team normalerweise im Quartal, da\\xad\\nrunter auch zum Teil Patienten aus dem Krankenhaus, \\ndas  zwar  über  eine  eigene  radiologische  Abteilung \\nverfügt, aber keine Fachärzte für Radiologie beschäftigt. \\nFeldgen gelingt es in den Tagen nach der Katastrophe, \\nin unzähligen Tele fonaten und über persönliche Kon\\xad\\ntakte, ein mobiles MRT\\xadGerät, einen mobilen Compu\\xad\\ntertomografen sowie zwei weitere Container jeweils für \\ndie Anmeldung und einen Wartebereich für die Pati\\xad\\nenten zu organisieren. Aufgestellt sind die mobilen \\nEinheiten jetzt auf dem Parkplatz des Marien\\xadHospitals. \\nZusätzliche Unter suchungskapazitäten gibt es in den \\nAbendstunden in der Partnerpraxis im knapp 20 Kilo\\xad\\nmeter entfernten Frechen. Dennoch können Wolff und \\nFeldgen  unter  diesen  Umständen  deutlich  weniger \\nPatienten untersuchen als zuvor – was für die Praxis\\xad\\ninhaber  auch  Honorar einbußen  zur  Folge  hat.  Die \\n beiden rechnen damit, dass sie Ende des Jahres ihre \\nPraxisräume wieder benutzen können. „Derweil arbei\\xad\\nten wir hier wie auf dem Campingplatz“, meint Wolff \\nund lacht. „Wir sind viel draußen und müssen zum Teil \\nauch  Patientengespräche  in  einem  stillen  Eckchen \\n unter freiem Himmel führen.“\\n\\nAuf finanzielle Nothilfen ist die Praxis nicht angewie\\xad\\nsen. Die Schäden seien zum großen Teil von der Ver\\xad\\nsicherung gedeckt, sagt Wolff. Beeindruckt ist das Team \\nvon der überwäl tigenden Hilfsbereitschaft, die ihnen  \\nin den Tagen nach der Katastrophe entgegengebracht \\n wurde – nicht nur von Familie und Freunden, sondern \\nauch von Nachbarn und Dorfbewohnern. So sei es ge\\xad\\nlungen, am Sonntag nach der Flut die Praxis gänzlich \\nvon Schutt und Schlamm zu befreien. „Bauern aus der \\nUmgebung haben ungefragt mit schwerem Gerät den \\nganzen Schutt abtransportiert. Ohne die hätten wir das \\ngar nicht geschafft“, sagt Dr. Markus Le Blanc. Er ist \\nRadiologe in der Partnerpraxis in Frechen und sozusa\\xad\\ngen  der  gute  Geist  beim  Aufbau  der  Mobileinheit  in \\nErftstadt. Erst heute hat er Praxisschilder besorgt, die \\ndie handgeschriebenen Wegweiser ersetzen. Er schätzt \\nan dem Praxisstandort die gute Erreichbarkeit und die \\nAnbindung  an  das  Marien\\xad Hospital.  „Aber  auch  die \\nKardiologen und die Urologen hier im Ärztehaus und \\ndie Kolleginnen und Kollegen aus der Umgebung sind \\nausgesprochen froh darüber, dass wir unsere Notver\\xad\\nsorgung aufgenommen haben. Es erspart den Patienten \\nlange Wege“, sagt Le Blanc. \\n\\nObwohl manches provisorisch ist und die Räum\\xad\\nlichkeiten beengt sind, sind die Radiologen froh, wie\\xad\\nder arbeiten zu können. „Natürlich hat man ein gewis\\xad\\nses Trauma davongetragen“, räumt Feldgen ein. „Aber \\nes  geht  weiter.“  Das  gesamte  Praxisteam  habe  mit \\n\\nRheinisches Ärzteblatt / Heft 10 / 2021  \\n\\n„Arbeiten wie auf dem Campingplatz“: Barbara Feldgen und Matthias Wolff \\nfreuen sich über das neue Hinweisschild, das Markus Le Blanc (v.l.) besorgt \\nhat. Es löst den handgeschriebenen Zettel ab.  \\n\\nFoto: Till Erdmenger\\n\\n angepackt und gesagt: „Wir bauen wieder auf, wir schaf\\xad\\nfen das.“ Es sei ihr wichtig, auch das weiterzugeben. \\n\\nDie Praxis der Radiologen in Erftstadt ist eine von \\n145 Arztpraxen, die vom Hochwasser beschädigt wur\\xad\\nden – manche schwer, andere weniger schwer. Wie das \\nnordrhein\\xadwestfälische Gesundheitsministerium auf \\nAnfrage mitteilt, sind neben dem Rhein\\xadErft\\xadKreis auch \\ndie  Region  Aachen,  der  Kreis  Euskirchen  und  der \\nRhein\\xadSieg\\xadKreis besonders stark betroffen. Zur Höhe \\nder entstandenen Schäden an den betroffenen Arzt\\xad\\npraxen könne man allerdings zurzeit noch keine ge\\xad\\nnauen Angaben machen, erklärt das Ministerium. Man \\ngehe aktuell von einem „in jedem Fall zweistelligen \\nMillionenbetrag“ aus. \\n\\nDrei Kliniken sind besonders betroffen\\n\\nRelativ exakt bemessen lassen sich die Schäden, die \\ndie Flut an den drei besonders betroffenen Kranken\\xad\\nhäusern in Nordrhein angerichtet hat. Im St. Antonius \\nHospital  in  Eschweiler  wird  der  Sachschaden  laut \\n Ministerium auf knapp 49 Millionen Euro geschätzt. \\nDort hat man inzwischen die ambulanten Behandlun\\xad\\ngen zum Beispiel in der Dialyse, der Endoskopie oder \\nim Brust\\xadZentrum wieder aufgenommen. Bei Redak\\xad\\ntionsschluss Mitte September war noch nicht klar, ob \\ndas  Krankenhaus  wie  erhofft  im  Oktober  auch  die \\n stationäre Versorgung wieder aufnehmen kann. \\n\\nFür das Klinikum Leverkusen liegen nach Angaben \\ndes Ministeriums noch keine detaillierten Schätzungen \\nder Schadenssumme vor. Vorläufig gehe man dort von \\neinem Sachschaden in Höhe von knapp 26 Millionen \\nEuro aus. Das Krankenhaus konnte schon gut zwei \\nWochen nach der Flutkatastrophe große Teile des Be\\xad\\ntriebs wieder aufnehmen.\\n\\nNach wie vor geschlossen ist dagegen das Marien\\xad \\nHospital in Erftstadt. Zu groß ist die Zerstörung, die \\n\\n13\\n\\nThema\\x0c Wiederaufbaufonds des Bundes sowie aus Spenden \\nund Eigenmitteln finanziert. „Aufgeschlüsselt rechne \\nich mit bis zu 14 Millionen Euro von den Versicherungen \\nund zwei Millionen Euro von den Kommunen. Durch \\nden Wiederaufbaufonds des Bundes werden wir wohl \\n80 Prozent des bleibenden Schadens erstattet bekom\\xad\\nmen“, erklärt Rips. „Außerdem haben wir eine eigene \\nSpendenaktion ins Leben gerufen, die inzwischen eine \\nknappe halbe Million Euro eingebracht hat.“ Darunter \\nseien  viele  Kleinspenden  aus  der  Bevölkerung,  die \\n deren Verbundenheit mit dem Krankenhaus zeige. „Das \\nist eine tolle Solidarität“, sagt Rips, der von 2009 bis \\n2012 Bürgermeister in Erftstadt war. \\n\\nRund 65 Millionen Euro an Soforthilfe sind nach \\nAngaben  des  NRW\\xadHeimatministeriums  bis  Anfang \\nSeptember an die Kommunen geflossen. Was davon \\nim  Einzelnen  Krankenhäusern  und  Praxen  zugute\\xad\\ngekommen sei, darüber lägen zurzeit keine Informa\\xad\\ntionen vor, heißt es dort. Der Gesamtverband der Deut\\xad\\nschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV) rechnet durch \\ndie Flut katastrophe in sämtlichen betroffenen Regio\\xad\\nnen  mit  Versicherungsschäden  von  rund  sieben \\n Milliarden Euro. Dabei lägen die tatsächlichen Unwet\\xad\\nterschäden noch weit über den aktuellen Schätzungen, \\nda nicht alle Gebäude gegen alle Naturgefahren ver\\xad\\nsichert seien, heißt es dort. Während bundesweit fast \\nalle Wohngebäude gegen Sturm und Hagel abgesichert \\nseien, besäßen nur 46 Prozent einen Schutz vor wei\\xad\\nteren Naturgefahren wie Starkregen und Hochwasser. \\nRegionale Daten über betroffene Gesundheitseinrich\\xad\\ntungen werde man erst später vorlegen können, erklärt \\nder GDV auf Anfrage. Die Evaluierung der Ereignisse \\ndurch die Versicherer vor Ort werde noch eine ganze \\nZeit andauern. \\n\\nEin Hochwasserschutzkonzept muss her\\n\\nDoch was gilt es, jetzt mit Blick auf mögliche künf\\xad\\ntige Überschwemmungen beim Wiederaufbau zu be\\xad\\nrücksichtigen? „Wir werden prüfen, ob wir mit Spund\\xad\\nwänden das Risiko etwas reduzieren können“, sagt \\nStiftungsvorstand Rips. Die Flut im Juli sei ein Jahr\\xad\\nhundertereignis gewesen, das sich allerdings ange\\xad\\nsichts der veränderten Klimasituation jetzt schneller \\nwiederholen könnte, meint der Jurist. „Grundsätzlich \\nist  der  Hochwasserschutz  aber  eine  politische  Auf\\xad\\ngabe.“ Er erwarte von der Politik, dass diese ein schlüs\\xad\\nsiges Gesamtkonzept erstelle und dazu gehöre auch \\nder bessere Schutz von Altenheim, Krankenhaus und \\nHospiz. \\n\\nDie momentane Schließung des Marien\\xadHospitals \\nbedeutet  nach  Ansicht  von  Rips  einen  erheblichen \\nEinschnitt für die Patientinnen und Patienten. „Unser \\nEinzugsbereich umfasst ungefähr 100.000 Menschen. \\nErftstadt und die angrenzenden Gemeinden sind auf \\nuns orientiert“, betont er. Auch der aktuelle Kranken\\xad\\nhausplan des Landes NRW verzeichne das Haus, in \\ndem jährlich gut 7.000 Patienten behandelt werden \\nund das seit fünf Jahren schwarze Zahlen schreibt, als \\n\\n„Es ist eigentlich alles kaputt“: Das Marien-Hospital in Erftstadt wird den \\nregulären Betrieb voraussichtlich erst in einem Jahr wieder aufnehmen  \\nkönnen. \\n\\nFoto: Till Erdmenger \\n\\ndie  Erft  dort  angerichtet  hat.  „Wir  hoffen,  dass  im \\n Oktober die Notfallambulanz wieder in Betrieb ist. Das \\nist die erste Priorität“, sagt der Vorstand der Stiftung \\nMarien\\xadHospital Erftstadt\\xadFrauenthal, Dr. jur. Franz\\xad \\nGeorg  Rips,  dem  Rheinischen  Ärzteblatt.  Mit  der \\nWieder aufnahme des regulären Krankenhausbetriebs \\nrechne  er  frühestens  in  einem  Jahr.  Den  Gesamt\\xad\\nschaden, den die Flut auf dem Gelände angerichtet \\nhat, beziffert Rips zurzeit mit etwa 21 bis 22 Millionen \\nEuro. „Es ist eigentlich alles kaputt“, stellt er fest. Im \\nGebäude müssen sämtliche Böden und Türen, Was\\xad\\nserversorgung, Heizungsanlage und Elektroinstalla\\xad\\ntionen  erneuert  werden.  Auch  die  medizinischen \\n Geräte seien unbrauchbar: die Röntgenanlage, das CT, \\ndas Linksherzkathetergerät, Beatmungs\\xad und Narkose\\xad\\ngeräte, Ultraschall\\xad und Echokardiografiegeräte, Infu\\xad\\nsionspumpen, OP\\xadTische, 130 Betten, sieben Intensiv\\xad\\nbetten – alles sei zerstört. Alleine in diesem Bereich \\nbelaufe sich der Schaden auf 5,5 Millionen Euro. \\n\\nNeben dem Krankenhaus betreibt die Stiftung auf \\ndem  Gelände  in  Erftstadt  noch  ein  Altenheim,  ein \\n Hospiz sowie eine Tagespflege und betreute Wohnun\\xad\\ngen.  „Wir  haben  im  Verwaltungsrat  den  Beschluss \\ngefasst,  alle  Einrichtungen  der  Stiftung  wieder  be\\xad\\ntriebsfähig zu machen. Und wir haben beschlossen, \\nalle 500 Arbeitsplätze zu erhalten“, betont Rips. Zurzeit \\nwürden die Gehälter über Kurzarbeitergeld finanziert \\nund zunächst bis Ende des Jahres aus Stiftungsmitteln \\nauf ein volles Grundgehalt aufgestockt. „Ob wir das \\ndanach wirtschaftlich noch schaffen, dazu kann ich \\njetzt noch keine endgültige Aussage treffen“, meint der \\nStiftungsvorstand. Bis Ende des Jahres rechne er mit \\nPersonalkosten von 4,2 Millionen Euro. \\n\\nDer Wiederaufbau des 134\\xadBetten\\xadHauses wird Rips \\nzufolge durch Versicherungsleistungen, Zuschüsse von \\nStadt,  Land  und  Kreis,  die  Inanspruchnahme  des \\n\\n14 \\n\\nRheinisches Ärzteblatt / Heft 10 / 2021\\n\\nThema\\x0cbedarfsgerecht. Im Schwerpunkt erbringt das Kran\\xad\\nkenhaus kardiologische Leistungen. Es verfügt zudem \\nüber eine kleinere Chirurgie sowie sieben Intensivbet\\xad\\nten, die nach dem Wiederaufbau auf zwölf aufgestockt \\nwerden sollen. Die enge Kooperation mit dem angren\\xad\\nzenden Ärztehaus ermöglicht es Rips zufolge darüber \\nhinaus, radiologische, onkologische und urologische \\nLeistungen anzubieten. Zurzeit würden die Patienten \\naus  Erftstadt  in  erster  Linie  in  Krankenhäusern  in \\n Frechen und Bedburg behandelt – Kliniken, mit denen \\nman ohnehin eng zusammenarbeite. Außerdem gebe \\nes Kapazitäten in Brühl und Köln. \\n\\nOffene Fragen müssen beantwortet werden\\n\\nWährend in den Flutgebieten der Wiederaufbau von \\nGebäuden und Infrastruktur vorangetrieben wird und \\ndie Menschen versuchen, erlittene Traumata zu bewäl\\xad\\ntigen, wird inzwischen auch die Frage nach Verant\\xad\\nwortlichkeiten gestellt. Wurde zu spät gewarnt? Wie \\naussagekräftig waren die Wetterwarnungen? War man \\nauf den Katastrophenfall zu schlecht vorbereitet? Funk\\xad\\ntionierte die Koordination der Rettungskräfte nicht gut \\ngenug? In einigen Kommunen in NRW und Rheinland\\xad \\nPfalz ermittelt die Staatsanwaltschaft.\\n\\nUm sich über die Erfahrungen in den Tagen vor, \\nwährend und nach der Flut auszutauschen, hatte die \\nCDU\\xadFraktion im Düsseldorfer Landtag am 2. Septem\\xad\\nber unter anderem Bürgermeister, Vertreter der Feuer\\xad\\nwehr, Katastrophenschützer und Rettungskräfte ein\\xad\\ngeladen. Dort lobte man zunächst einhellig die gute \\nund koordinierte Zusammenarbeit der Rettungskräfte \\nuntereinander ebenso wie mit den zahllosen „Spon\\xad\\ntanhelfern“ aus allen Teilen Deutschlands. Kritik gab \\nes jedoch an der Präzision der Wetter\\xad und Hochwas\\xad\\nserprognosen. „Grundsätzlich fehlten in allen amtli\\xad\\nchen und sämtlichen Mitteilungen auch der übergeord\\xad\\nneten Behörden konkrete Hinweise auf die tatsächliche \\nTragweite dieses Ereignisses“, sagte die Bürgermeiste\\xad\\nrin von Erftstadt, Caroline Weitzel, in Düsseldorf. „Das \\nführte dazu, dass wir vor Ort keine Notfallpläne vor\\xad\\nbereiten konnten.“ Für die Zukunft müsse die Frage \\ngeklärt werden, wer die Wetterdaten zum Beispiel des \\nDeutschen Wetterdienstes auswerten, diese mit hydro\\xad\\nlogischen Wasserständen und Prognosen zusammen\\xad\\nführen und dann umgehend weitergeben solle. „Dieses \\nPersonal haben wir in einer Kommune wie Erftstadt \\nnicht“, sagte die CDU\\xadPolitikerin. Im konkreten Fall \\nseien  außerdem  Informationen  des  für  den  Hoch\\xad\\n≠wasserschutz zuständigen Erftverbandes nicht an die \\nStadt weitergeleitet worden.\\n\\nKritisiert wurde darüber hinaus von vielen Teilneh\\xad\\nmern, dass die Kommunikationsinfrastruktur sich im \\naktuellen Katastrophenfall als zu wenig robust erwie\\xad\\nsen habe. Auch Bürgermeisterin Weitzel erklärte, der \\ngleichzeitige Ausfall von Mobil\\xad und Digitalfunk, Fest\\xad\\nnetztelefon und Internet sowie der teilweise Zusam\\xad\\nmenbruch der Verkehrsinfrastruktur habe die Lage\\xad\\nbewertung im Katastrophengebiet äußerst erschwert. \\n\\nRheinisches Ärzteblatt / Heft 10 / 2021  \\n\\nAus Sicht der CDU\\xadPolitikerin ist es zwingend erfor\\xad\\nderlich, dass für zukünftige Krisenfälle dieser Größen\\xad\\nordnung eine Task Force eingerichtet wird und dass \\nrealistische Krisenszenarien regelmäßig geübt werden. \\nExperten sagten aufgrund des Klimawandels die Zu\\xad\\nnahme von Extremwetterereignissen voraus. „Darauf \\nmüssen wir uns vorbereiten“, forderte Weitzel. \\n\\nDie Erft bei Liblar: Es fehlten „konkrete Hinweise auf die tatsächliche  \\nTragweite dieses Ereignisses“, sagte die Bürgermeisterin von Erftstadt,  \\nCaroline Weitzel, nach der verheerenden Flut. \\n\\nFoto: Till Erdmenger\\n\\nHilfe für die Flutopfer\\n\\nAm 23.

The July 2021 ﬂood in central Europe was one\\nof the ﬁve costliest disasters in Europe in the last half cen-\\ntury, with an estimated total damage of EUR 32 billion. The\\naim of this study is to analyze and assess the ﬂood within\\nan interdisciplinary approach along its entire process chain:\\nthe synoptic setting of the atmospheric pressure ﬁelds, the\\nprocesses causing the high rainfall totals, the extraordinary\\nstreamﬂows and water levels in the affected catchments, the\\nhydro-morphological effects, and the impacts on infrastruc-\\nture and society. In addition, we address the question of what\\nmeasures are possible to generate added value to early re-\\nsponse management in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.\\nThe superposition of several factors resulted in widespread\\nextreme precipitation totals and water levels well beyond a\\n100-year event: slow propagation of the low pressure sys-\\ntem Bernd, convection embedded in a mesoscale precipita-\\ntion ﬁeld, unusually moist air masses associated with a sig-\\nniﬁcant positive anomaly in sea surface temperature over the\\nBaltic Sea, wet soils, and steep terrain in the affected catch-\\nments. Various hydro-morphodynamic processes as well as\\n\\nchanges in valley morphology observed during the event ex-\\nacerbated the impact of the ﬂood. Relevant effects included,\\namong many others, the occurrence of extreme landscape\\nerosion, rapidly evolving erosion and scour processes in the\\nchannel network and urban space, recruitment of debris from\\nthe natural and urban landscape, and deposition and clogging\\nof bottlenecks in the channel network with eventual collapse.\\nThe estimation of inundation areas as well as the derived\\ndamage assessments were carried out during or directly after\\nthe ﬂood and show the potential of near-real-time forensic\\ndisaster analyses for crisis management, emergency person-\\nnel on-site, and the provision of relief supplies. This study\\nis part one of a two-paper series. The second part (Ludwig\\net al., 2022) puts the July 2021 ﬂood into a historical context\\nand into the context of climate change.\\n\\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\\n\\n\\x0c526\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe severe ﬂood event in western Germany and neighbor-\\ning countries in mid-July 2021 was one of the most severe\\ncatastrophes in Europe in the last half century. Precipitation\\ntotals of up to 150 mm over an extensive area falling within\\n15 to 18 h led to the severe ﬂooding particularly on 14 and\\n15 July 2021. The ﬂood claimed many lives, with at least\\n180 fatalities in Germany alone. The two German federal\\nstates of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Rhineland-\\nPalatinate (RP) were particularly affected, but also the neigh-\\nboring countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxem-\\nbourg. In Germany, the ﬂood had a devastating effect in the\\nnortheast of the low mountain range Eifel, where villages\\nalong the rivers Ahr and Erft, both left tributaries of the\\nRhine, were affected (Fig. 1). Severe damage was caused\\nto buildings, household goods, industry, but also to infras-\\ntructure such as railways, roads, and bridges. According to\\nMunich Re (2022), total losses amount to EUR 46 billion,\\nEUR 33 billion of which was in Germany alone, making this\\nevent the most expensive catastrophe in Germany to date.\\nThe insured portion was relatively low at EUR 8.2 billion in\\nGermany (all countries EUR 11 billion; Munich Re, 2022)\\nbecause of a low insurance density of residential buildings\\n(only about 37 % to 47 % are insured) and infrastructure\\ndamage in that region.\\n\\nThe Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduc-\\ntion Technology (CEDIM, https://www.cedim.kit.edu/, last\\naccess: 13 November 2022), an interdisciplinary research\\ncenter in the ﬁeld of disasters, risks, and security at Karl-\\nsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, has been\\nconducting forensic disaster analyses (FDAs) in near-real-\\ntime since 2011 (e.g., Kunz et al., 2013; Merz et al., 2014;\\nPiper et al., 2016; Wilhelm et al., 2021). The approach of\\nforensically investigating disasters stems from the interdis-\\nciplinary research program integrated research on disaster\\nrisk (IRDR) and their program forensic investigation of dis-\\nasters (FORIN; Burton, 2010). IRDR uses the forensic ap-\\nproach to uncover the root causes of disasters through in-\\ndepth investigations and to build an understanding of how\\nhazards do or do not become disasters. CEDIM aims for a\\ntimely analysis within a few hours to a few days after the\\nevent. CEDIM’s FDAs examine the dynamics and interrela-\\ntions of disasters, identiﬁes major risk drivers, estimates the\\nimpact (damage, fatalities, displaced people), and infers pos-\\nsible implications for disaster mitigation – as was the case in\\nJuly 2021 on the extraordinary ﬂood event, for which the re-\\nport with ﬁrst damage estimates was issued only 1 week after\\nthe event (Schäfer et al., 2021). This FDA report summariz-\\ning ﬁndings from different disciplines, but also more detailed\\nanalyses performed in the months after the ﬂood, for exam-\\nple, concerning the relation to climate change, motivated us\\nfor this two-part paper.\\n\\nEfﬁcient and effective emergency management is essen-\\ntial to reduce the adverse effects from disasters, particularly\\n\\nS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 ﬂood event – Part 1\\n\\nin the case of sudden-onset natural hazards (Ye et al., 2020).\\nA prerequisite for disaster response is to get as reliable and\\ntimely an overview as possible of the severity and extent of\\nan event to identify most vulnerable facilities and areas, to\\nprioritize emergency measures, or to organize evacuations if\\nnecessary (Merz et al., 2020). New opportunities for disaster\\nresponse arise on the one hand from technological advances\\nin recent years, such as surveillance by drones, information\\napps for smartphones, or crowd-sourcing of information via\\nsocial networks, and on the other hand from better under-\\nstanding of human behavior in the emergency phase and the\\nsocietal context (Kreibich et al., 2017; Aerts et al., 2018).\\nHowever, these are often not adequately taken into account\\nand implemented in practice and decision-making processes\\n– also showcased by the 2021 ﬂood.\\n\\nTo better assess, predict, and manage catastrophes such\\nas the July 2021 ﬂood, close collaboration and interactions\\namong scientists and practitioners across discipline bound-\\naries are absolutely vital. A multi-disciplinary framework\\nsuch as FDAs enables assessing the complex interactions\\nof processes across different compartments from meteorol-\\nogy (e.g., weather situation, precipitation) to hydrological\\nconditions (e.g., river basins, ﬂow characteristics) to hydro-\\nmorphological impacts (e.g., changes in valleys morphology,\\nerosion, and deposition areas) to impacts on assets and en-\\nvironment. The objective of this two-part study is a multi-\\ndisciplinary assessment of the entire process chain of the\\nJuly 2021 ﬂood in central Europe – from causes to impacts\\nto historical classiﬁcation and climatological context. We ad-\\ndress the following main research questions: (1) what were\\nthe hydro-meteorological causes of the July 2021 ﬂood, and\\nwhat interactions and impacts were observed? What made\\nthe ﬂood so exceptional? (2) What additional information can\\nbe generated directly in the aftermath of an extreme ﬂood\\nevent to support disaster management and how reliable are\\nﬁrst estimates? While Part 1 focuses on the description of the\\nevent across various disciplines (meteorological, hydrologi-\\ncal, hydro-morphological, economic) and addresses the as-\\npect regarding early response, the second part (Ludwig et al.,\\n2022, henceforth referred to as PART2) puts the event in both\\nhistorical and anthropogenic climate change contexts.\\n\\nThe paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the\\ndifferent data sets and methods used. Section 3 discusses\\nthe prevailing meteorological and hydrological particulari-\\nties and characteristics before and during the July 2021 ﬂood,\\nfollowed by a discussion of the hydro-morphodynamic pro-\\ncesses in relation to the ﬂood. Section 4 addresses the im-\\npacts and consequences with a focus on near-real-time es-\\ntimation of inundation areas, damage assessment, and rail\\nand road infrastructure failure. Finally, Sect. 6 discusses and\\nsummarizes the main results, draws conclusions, and pro-\\nvides an outlook on Part 2.\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Overview map of the most affected region within the European context (inset at small bottom right), with the main rivers (blue),\\nriver gauges (red), and reservoirs (brown) addressed in the paper, including the catchments of the rivers Ahr and Erft (hatched gray). In\\naddition, the low mountain range Eifel, the Ardennes (both part of the Rhenish Slate Mountains), the low terrace plain Cologne Bay (gray\\ncapital letters), and the border between the two federal states North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Rhineland-Palatinate (RP) are labeled\\n(dark blue).\\n\\n2 Data and methods\\n\\nThe region most affected in July 2021 by the heavy rainfall\\nand subsequent ﬂooding, and thus our region of main inter-\\nest, is a low mountain range named Eifel with steep, deeply\\ncarved valleys. It is located in western Germany (mainly in\\nthe federal state of RP), eastern Luxembourg, and southeast-\\nern Belgium (see Fig. 1). In the west, the Eifel is limited by\\nthe river Meuse, in the south by the river Moselle, and in\\nthe east by the river Rhine. To the west, the Eifel is contin-\\nued by the low mountain region of the Ardennes in Belgium\\nand to the north by the lowland region of the Cologne Bay\\nin Germany. In total, the region covers roughly 20 000 km2\\n(150 × 130 km), which is unusually large for the registered\\nhigh precipitation intensities and totals (see Sect. 3.1) and a\\nkey characteristic of this event.\\n\\n2.1 Analysis and weather forecast data\\n\\nGeopotential pattern, precipitable water, and sea surface tem-\\nperature (SST) from the European Centre for Medium-Range\\nWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis data (Hers-\\nbach et al., 2020) interpolated to a 0.5◦ grid were used for\\nanalyses during the ﬂood event and for climatological as-\\nsessment (anomalies). In addition, based on these data, the\\n\\npathway of air masses that reached the affected region was\\ninvestigated with 10 d kinematic backward trajectories us-\\ning the Lagrangian analysis tool (LAGRANTO; Sprenger\\nand Wernli, 2015). The trajectories are based on the three-\\ndimensional (3D) wind ﬁeld (u, v, ω) on all model levels at a\\nhorizontal grid spacing of 0.5◦×0.5◦ and temporal resolution\\nof 3 h. The backward trajectories were initialized every 6 h\\nbetween 14 July 06:00 UTC and 15 July 06:00 UTC at four\\ngrid points (51.0, 50.5, 50.0, 51.0◦ N; 7.0, 7.0, 6.5, 6.5◦ E;\\nsee Fig. 1). Following Sodemann et al. (2008), we started the\\ntrajectories vertically every 30 hPa between 970 and 590 hPa\\nand considered only those which exhibit a relative humidity\\ngreater than 80 % at their initial time.\\n\\nThe predictability of the event is assessed by operational\\nforecasts with the ICON model from the German Meteoro-\\nlogical Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) for differ-\\nent horizontal resolutions and lead times. The ICON model\\nwas introduced into DWD’s operational forecast system in\\nJanuary 2015 (Zängl et al., 2015). In this study, we used\\nthe regional reﬁnements of the global ICON forecast over\\nEurope (ICON-EU, 7 km horizontal grid spacing) and Ger-\\nmany (ICON-D2, 2.2 km grid spacing) as well as output\\nfrom the ICON-D2 ensemble prediction systems (ICON-D2-\\nEPS). The considered ICON-EU simulations are initialized\\nat 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC and provide forecasts\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n\\n\\x0c528\\n\\nS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 ﬂood event – Part 1\\n\\nfor the next 120 h. The higher resolved ICON-D2 simula-\\ntions are initialized every 3 h (00:00, 03:00 UTC, etc.) and\\nprovide 27 h forecasts. In addition, the DWD produces en-\\nsemble forecasts with the ICON-D2-EPS based on 20 en-\\nsemble members (Reinert et al., 2020) for the same initial\\ntimes and domain as ICON-D2.\\n\\nAdditionally, the extreme forecast index (EFI) for precip-\\nitation based on the ensemble prediction systems (EPS) of\\nECMWF was considered to assess the possibility of the oc-\\ncurrence of extreme weather. The EFI indicates whether the\\nECMWF-EPS forecast distribution is substantially different\\nfrom the model climate (more details about EFI see, e.g.,\\nLalaurette, 2003; Zsoter et al., 2015). An EFI of 0.5 to 0.8\\nindicates an unusual event, and EFI values above 0.8 indi-\\ncate a very unusual or extreme event.\\n\\n2.2 Precipitation data\\n\\nTo quantify precipitation amounts during the ﬂood event,\\nhourly and daily precipitation totals at single ground-based\\nobservational stations were taken from the network operated\\nby DWD comprising about 2000 stations in Germany. The\\ntemporal resolution of the precipitation measurements is usu-\\nally 1 h, but can reach up to 1 min. Unless otherwise noted,\\ndaily precipitation readings cover the period from 05:50 to\\n05:50 UTC to match with other data sets used in this study.\\n\\nIn addition, different gridded precipitation data sets pro-\\nvided by DWD were used in this study for both the\\nevent analysis and the estimation of return periods,\\nin-\\ncluding daily HYRAS data (Hydrometeorologische Raster-\\ndatensätze; Rauthe et al., 2013) and hourly RADOLAN\\ndata (Radar-Online-Aneichung; Weigl and Winterrath, 2009;\\nWinterrath et al., 2018). HYRAS is a gridded data set cov-\\nering Germany and its relevant river basins in neighboring\\ncountries at a 5 × 5 km2 grid resolution currently available\\nfor the period from 1951 to 2015 (update in preparation).\\nIt is based on several thousand climate stations interpolated\\nto the regular grid considering elevation, exposition, and\\nclimatology. A sub-sample of HYRAS is the HYRAS-DE\\ndata, formerly known as REGNIE (Regionalisierte Nieder-\\nschlagshöhen), covering only Germany but with a higher res-\\nolution of 1 km2. HYRAS-DE is continuously updated on a\\ndaily basis and thus available for the July 2021 event. Caldas-\\nAlvarez et al. (2022) found that HYRAS-DE reﬂects well the\\nabsolute frequency of precipitation observations and is well\\nsuited for process-based and statistical analyses of extreme\\nprecipitation.\\n\\nRADOLAN is a radar-based near-real-time precipitation\\ndata set covering Germany and parts of the neighboring\\ncountries, with a horizontal resolution of roughly 1 km2\\nand an hourly temporal resolution and has been available\\nsince 2001. Measured reﬂectivities Z of the 17 radar sites op-\\nerated by DWD are converted into precipitation rates R using\\nseasonal differentiated empirical Z–R relations. To account\\nfor uncertainties in this conversion as well as for typical radar\\n\\nartifacts, the radar-based precipitation rates are calibrated us-\\ning hourly data of over 1000 ground-based observational sta-\\ntions by applying different weighting and comparative tech-\\nniques.\\n\\nAntecedent wetness conditions in a river basin can be a\\ndecisive factor whether a rainfall event becomes a ﬂood or\\nnot. Therefore, we used the established antecedent precipita-\\ntion index (API; Kohler and Linsley, 1951; Viessman et al.,\\n2002), which was applied to the RADOLAN data aggregated\\nto a daily temporal resolution, to describe the conditions prior\\nto the event. The suitability of API as a soil moisture proxy\\nwas shown, for example, by Blanchard et al. (1981) or Teng\\net al. (1993). API is based on a weighted precipitation ac-\\ncumulation over several days, typically 7 to 14 d (Heggen,\\n2001). In line with Schröter et al. (2015), we used a precon-\\ndition period of 30 d in this study. The weighting factor k was\\nset to k = 0.9 as suggested by Heggen (2001) or Schröter\\net al. (2015).\\n\\n2.3 River gauge data\\n\\nAll water level W and streamﬂow Q data from gauges used\\nin this study were provided by the water administrations of\\nRhineland-Palatinate, the Erftverband, and the Wupperver-\\nband. From the large number of gauge data made available\\nto us, for brevity we selected a representative subset based\\non the objectives of (a) covering our region of main interest\\n– from the river Wupper in the east to the river Amblève in\\nthe west, (b) covering a range of basin sizes – from 31.9 km2\\nat gauge Schönau (Erft) to 816 km2 at gauge Kordel (Kyll),\\nand (c) covering the position along streams – wherever pos-\\nsible we selected two gauges per river, one in the headwater\\nand one close to its junction (see Fig. 1; river names in blue,\\ngauge names in red, reservoir names in brown). Addition-\\nally, we selected gauges of special interest, such as gauge\\nSchönau (Erft) for its proximity to retention basin Horch-\\nheim (see Sect. 3.2), gauge Bliesheim (Erft) for its proximity\\nto the pit at Blessem (urban district of the town Erftstadt; see\\nSect. 3.3), and gauge Altenahr (Ahr) for the morphological\\neffects in the river Ahr (see Sect. 3.3) and its historical con-\\ntext (cf. Part 2).\\n\\nWater level data are from direct observations; streamﬂow\\ndata were calculated by the water authorities from water\\nlevel observations and gauge-speciﬁc water level–discharge\\nrelations (W –Q relations), including uncertainties of about\\n15 % to 20 %. A summary of the gauge data is given in Ta-\\nble 1 (see Sect. 3.2). In cases where water level data were\\neither not available (mainly due to gauge destruction), wa-\\nter levels exceeded the existing W –Q relations, or W –Q re-\\nlations becoming invalid because of morphological changes\\nof the river bed, streamﬂow data were estimated by the wa-\\nter authorities. In particular, the streamﬂow time series at\\ngauge Altenahr (Ahr) that was completely destroyed during\\nthe ﬂood was reconstructed based on ﬂoating debris lines at\\nbuildings, recordings of upstream gauges, and observed rain-\\n\\nNat.

In the Erft river basin, most gauges – among\\nthem Schönau and Bliesheim – were heavily bypassed dur-\\ning the ﬂood, and water levels exceeded any recorded levels\\nand W –Q relations. For gauge Schönau, peak ﬂow was esti-\\nmated from rates of change of basin volume of the ﬂood re-\\ntention basin Eicherscheid, located 1.6 km downstream of the\\ngauge. For gauge Bliesheim, the peak ﬂow was estimated us-\\ning a two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic model (Hydro_as-2d)\\nto reproduce observed water levels. For the model, feasible\\nranges of roughness coefﬁcients suggest an uncertainty range\\nfor peak ﬂow of ±100 m3 s−1. At gauge Opladen (Wupper),\\nthe recorded peak water level of about 466 cm was also well\\nbeyond the limit of the existing W –Q relation of 400 cm.\\nStreamﬂow values beyond were reconstructed using a 2D hy-\\ndraulic model (Hydro_as-2d). During the ﬂood, the river\\ncross-section at Opladen was excavated by 40 to 50 cm, mak-\\ning the ﬂood not only a hydrological but also a morphological\\nevent (see also Sect. 3.3).\\n\\n2.4 Data for the estimation of inundation areas\\n\\nData of the earth observation satellites Sentinel-1 and\\nSentinel-2 of the Copernicus program (Sentinel Hub, 2021),\\namong others, were used to estimate the inundation areas.\\nDepending on the current ascension, new satellite imagery is\\navailable every second or third day. Sentinel-1 provides syn-\\n\\nthetic aperture radar imaging independent of weather condi-\\ntions with a maximum spatial resolution of 5 m. These data\\nallowed us to utilize imagery as early as 15 July, indepen-\\ndent of the occurring cloud cover. In contrast, Sentinel-2 pro-\\nvides true color imagery with a maximum resolution of 10 m,\\nwhich is sensitive to weather conditions. Thus, initial im-\\nagery of Sentinel-2 from 16 July could not be used due to ex-\\ntensive cloud cover. The ﬁrst clear sky imagery was available\\nfrom 18 July. The Sentinel-2 imagery proved more useful due\\nto its true color imagery, as the Sentinel-1 radar images could\\nnot resolve most of the inundation areas (see Sect. 4).\\n\\nWhile the ﬂood was still ongoing, the CEDIM FDA task\\nforce manually gathered both aerial imagery and photos to\\nget a quick overview of the overall situation of the inunda-\\ntion area. During this period, information about the extent\\nof the ﬂooding was disseminated mainly through news and\\nsocial media. Some news channels broadcasted from heli-\\ncopters ﬂying over the region and provided aerial imagery.\\nIn addition, private videos from drone pilots (e.g., available\\nvia YouTube) supplemented the material. In particular, infor-\\nmation from social media (e.g., YouTube, Twitter, Facebook)\\nprovided signiﬁcant added value. Each photo and video col-\\nlected was manually georeferenced and utilized to create\\ngeospatial vertices of the inundation areas. In many cases,\\nthe correct location, where a photo was taken or the ﬂight\\npath of the helicopter or drone, had to be determined ﬁrst.\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\n\\nNat.

Mohr et al.: The July 2021 ﬂood event – Part 1\\n\\nSimple landmarks such as garden fences or buildings helped.\\nBy comparing the photo and video footage with satellite im-\\nages acquired in previous years (e.g., Google Earth), it was\\npossible to roughly estimate the inundation areas.\\n\\n2.5 Trafﬁc data\\n\\nIn order to estimate medium-term effects of the ﬂood on\\ntransportation infrastructure, Deutsche Bahn AG (DB) pro-\\nvided data on rail\\ntrafﬁc disruptions from mid-July to\\nmid-October 2021 for NRW and from mid-July to mid-\\nSeptember 2021 for RP. The DB data were pre-ﬁltered and\\ncontain only ﬂood-related reports. The number of disrupted\\nlines on certain key dates in the period under consideration\\n(approx. every 4 weeks) was evaluated.\\n\\nFor the same time period, road trafﬁc data were used,\\nwhich are equivalent to the reports issued by the police\\nto, for example, radio stations. We obtained the informa-\\ntion from the internet platform https://stau1.de/ (last access:\\n13 November 2022), which provides historical congestion\\nand trafﬁc reports from Germany. As there was no pre-\\nﬁltering for the road data regarding the ﬂood, we developed\\nour own ﬁlter that contains ﬂood-related words. This ensured\\nthat all trafﬁc reports that explicitly refer to the ﬂood are\\nincluded. Note that if trafﬁc reports did not contain ﬂood-\\nrelated words but were induced by the ﬂood, they were not\\nevaluated. In order to check the validity of the data, the anal-\\nysis was supplemented by quality controls. Reports for the\\nsame route and route section were combined.\\n\\n2.6 Extreme value statistics\\n\\nIn both parts of this two-paper series, extreme value statis-\\ntics were used to estimate return periods TRP(x) of precip-\\nitation events x (or vice versa, xRV(T )) from both observa-\\ntions (Part 1) and model data (Part 2). Making use of the\\nPeak-over-threshold approach (POT; Wilks, 2006), only pre-\\ncipitation events above the 95th percentile were considered\\nfor the analysis. To this upper tail of the distribution, a three-\\nparameter generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) was ﬁtted\\n(e.g., van Montfort and Witter, 1986; Coles et al., 2001;\\nBrabson and Palutikof, 2000). The scale parameter and the\\nshape parameter resulted from the ﬁt using the maximum\\nlikelihood estimation (MLE). The statistical uncertainty of\\nthe return periods (95 % conﬁdence interval) was estimated\\nusing a bivariate normal distribution (Kotz and Nadarajah,\\n2000).\\n\\nAdjusting statistical distribution functions to a data se-\\nries allows for estimating high return periods beyond the\\navailable time period. Furthermore, the comparatively strong\\nnoise or high random component of an empirical return pe-\\nriod estimation (e.g., block maximum) is reduced to a certain\\ndegree (e.g., Bezak et al., 2014).\\n\\n2.7 Loss modeling\\n\\nUsing the loss models available in CEDIM (e.g., Daniell\\net al., 2011, 2018; Mühr et al., 2017) and empirical data from\\npast ﬂood disasters (hazard information, infrastructural, and\\nother damage), a ﬁrst rapid loss assessment was carried out\\nas part of the FDA activity immediately after the ﬂood event\\n(Schäfer et al., 2021). A central element for this assessment\\nwas a very large natural hazard database with over 60 000 en-\\ntries (CATDAT; Daniell et al., 2011, 2016; EEA, 2022) built\\nup by CEDIM in recent years.\\n\\nThe following characteristics and assumptions were made\\n\\nas part of the damage modeling:\\n\\na. Based on the inundation areas, 9694 buildings in RP and\\n9702 buildings in NRW were identiﬁed to be affected.\\n\\nb. Based on the capital stock model used in Wilhelm et al.\\n(2021), a capital stock of EUR 8.92 billion (excluding\\ninfrastructure) was associated with these buildings.\\n\\nc. The damage ratio deﬁned within the ﬂooded locations\\nof the inundation areas ranged between 15 % and 33 %\\n(economic damage as percentage of capital stock). This\\nwas derived from previous analyses of past ﬂood events.\\nThe damage ratio range was derived from the propor-\\ntional integration of various vulnerability curves with\\nbuilding stock data of the most affected areas in NRW\\nand RP assuming a typical building style of 2–3-story\\nbuildings.\\n\\nd. Given the unknown number of affected buildings and\\ninfrastructure outside of the estimated footprints from\\nSect. 4.1, scaling factors ranging between 3.4 and 8.1\\nwere used to estimate the share of damage in these re-\\ngions. These scaling factors represent the additional ex-\\nposure vs. that of the mapped inundation areas. This\\napproach is in line with existing studies under the\\nWorld Bank’s global rapid post-disaster damage estima-\\ntion (GRADE) methodology (Gunasekera et al., 2018)1\\nwhen estimating damage in locations where absolute in-\\nundation depths are unknown.\\n\\n3 Event description and analysis\\n\\nIn terms of addressing the research question of what made the\\nJuly 2021 ﬂood event so extraordinary, it is becoming clear\\nthat several factors at various spatial and temporal scales\\nwere decisive for the catastrophic July 2021 ﬂood event.\\n\\n1The GRADE approach, developed by the World Bank and sup-\\nported by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recov-\\nery (GFDRR), is designed to provide governments and other key\\nstakeholders involved in post-disaster damage assessment, relief,\\nand recovery phases with initial rapid estimations of physical post-\\ndisaster damage within 2 weeks.\\n\\nNat.

Mohr et al.: The July 2021 ﬂood event – Part 1\\n\\n531\\n\\nBased on analyses of model and observational data and com-\\nplemented by our own simulations and assessments, we dis-\\ncuss in the following the complex interactions between me-\\nteorological (Sect. 3.1), hydrological (Sect. 3.2), and hydro-\\nmorphodynamic (Sect. 3.3) processes and mechanisms.\\n\\n3.1 Meteorological aspects\\n\\n3.1.1 Atmospheric conditions prior and during the\\n\\nﬂood event\\n\\nSynoptic overview and atmospheric characteristics\\n\\nOn 10 July 2021, a prominent upper-level trough was lo-\\ncated over the Atlantic Ocean, moving rapidly to the south-\\neast. Two days later, the trough structure with its meridional\\noriented axis extended from the western North Sea across\\nthe English Channel and the western half of France to the\\nBalearic Islands. Subsequently, the upper-level trough was\\nblocked by a quasi-stationary anticyclone located over north-\\neastern Europe, which had already remained in the region\\nfor 3 weeks (not shown). Ahead of the approaching trough,\\nthe air pressure began to drop and a surface low pressure\\nsystem named Bernd formed over the North German Plain\\n(dashed 1010 hPa contour in Fig. 2a), exactly where the most\\nintense precipitation was later observed. Bernd and the as-\\nsociated frontal system moved ﬁrst very slowly eastward,\\nwith its center moving from southern Switzerland/northwest-\\nern Italy across the Alps towards southern Germany, and at\\nlater stages retrograde (westward). Analyses of the middle\\ntroposphere reveal a shortwave trough on the northwestern\\nﬂank of the low pressure system (solid contour in Fig. 2a),\\nwhich provided an additional atmospheric uplift, increasing\\nthe precipitation intensity. The extensive central European\\nlow pressure complex included extremely moist air masses in\\nits circulation (colored areas in Fig. 2a). Over northern Ger-\\nmany, very high values of total precipitable water of more\\nthan 40 kg m−2 were reached.\\n\\nThese very high values of total precipitable water suggest\\nthat the moisture-laden air masses contributed to the extreme\\nprecipitation totals in the affected region. In order to investi-\\ngate the pathway of the moisture-laden air mass and to iden-\\ntify possible source regions of moisture prior to the event,\\nwe evaluated the 10 d history of air masses with the trajec-\\ntory approach (see Sect. 2.1). As we were particularly inter-\\nested in moisture uptake due to surface evaporation, we fo-\\ncused on air parcels at the time when they were located in the\\nplanetary boundary layer (PBL). The density of air parcels\\nlocated in the PBL over the entire 10 d period is shown in\\nFig. 2b. The majority were located over northern central Eu-\\nrope, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. From there, the air\\nmasses were transported towards the affected region on the\\nnorthern ﬂank of Bernd. Considering all air parcels in and\\nabove the PBL, a similar spatial distribution was obtained\\n(not shown). The large fraction over the North and Baltic\\n\\nseas is noteworthy since both regions were characterized by\\nunusual SST anomalies of up to 8 K during this period (col-\\nored contours in Fig. 2b), which was a consequence of the\\nblocking situation described above and the associated cloud-\\nfree conditions and high solar insolation. This indicates that\\nsurface evaporation over the North Sea and Baltic Sea served\\nas major moisture source prior to the event. Similar conclu-\\nsions were also drawn by Tuel et al. (2022), who in addi-\\ntion to the unusual SST anomalies over the North and Baltic\\nseas established a connection with the repeated Rossby wave\\nbreaking caused by a persistent meridionally ampliﬁed ﬂow\\nover the Atlantic, initiating a favorable dynamic setting on\\nthe large-scale for extremes. Heavy precipitation associated\\nwith quasi-stationary low pressure systems, their fronts, or\\nconvective systems located on the western ﬂank of persis-\\ntent blocking systems is observed frequently in Europe dur-\\ning summer and has often led to weather extremes with se-\\nvere (economic) consequences (Grams et al., 2014; Piper\\net al., 2016; Lenggenhager and Martius, 2019; Mohr et al.,\\n2019, 2020; Kautz et al., 2022).\\n\\nPrecipitation ﬁelds and statistics\\n\\nAs a result of upper-level shortwave troughs, a large area\\nwith widespread heavy precipitation formed over southwest-\\nern Germany already in the morning of 13 July (see Figs. S1a\\nand S2a in the Supplement). This happened in accordance\\nwith the cyclonic rotation around the trough, and the precipi-\\ntation area ﬁrst moved northeastward, then northward, before\\nturning westward over northern Germany and ﬁnally ﬁnd-\\ning its way into NRW and RP. The heavy precipitation event\\nleading to the devastating ﬂoods was predominantly strati-\\nform in nature, but with embedded areas of convective heav-\\nier rain as shown by radar imagery (not shown). The rain be-\\ngan during the early morning hours on 14 July, for example,\\nat the DWD weather station in Cologne-Stammheim around\\n04:00 UTC (see Fig. S3). In the Ahr catchment, precipita-\\ntion started almost at the same time, for example at the DWD\\nstation of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, located near the mouth\\ninto the Rhine, at around 05:00 UTC. Initially, it rained only\\nlightly and irregularly, but covering almost the entire catch-\\nment area from about 09:30 UTC. Around noon, precipita-\\ntion intensiﬁed, and between 13:30 and 17:30 UTC, the high-\\nest precipitation intensities were observed in the Eifel region.\\nFrom 17:30 UTC onwards, precipitation weakened from the\\neast, and before midnight, the rain event ceased. Thus, the\\nmajor part of the precipitation totals contributing to the ﬂood\\nfell in the affected river catchments within approximately\\n15 h on 14 July.\\n\\nDuring this period, precipitation totals of up to 150 mm\\nwere recorded, for example, at Cologne-Stammheim (see\\nFig. S3 and Table S1 in the Supplement). The maximum\\nhourly precipitation intensity reached 33 mm. The long-term\\naverage for the month of July at this station, however, is only\\n69 mm (1981–2010).

Note that the RADOLAN data have been remapped to the 5 km HYRAS grid in (b) as the climato-\\nlogical values are taken from HYRAS (reference period: 1951 to 2015). The black rectangles indicate the regions named LReg and SReg;\\nthe red contour outlines the Ahr catchment; the main rivers are given by blue.\\n\\nshowed precipitation totals between 62 mm near the river\\nRhine and 144.8 mm in the Euskirchen district at the edge of\\nthe northern Eifel (station Kall-Sistig; see Table S1). Thus,\\nthe rain amounts exceeded the usual monthly July precipita-\\ntion at most of the stations.\\n\\nThe large spatial extent of the high precipitation area can\\nalso be clearly seen in the RADOLAN data (Figs. 3a and S1).\\nOur focus region regarding precipitation is largely repre-\\nsented by the larger blackrectangle in Fig. 3 (w.r.t. Part 2\\nhereafter LReg), while the smaller black rectangle (hereafter\\n\\nSReg, cf. part 2 Sect. 2 for details) covers the highest pre-\\ncipitation totals with the mainly affected Ahr catchment (red\\ncontour). On average, the 24 h precipitation totals on 14 July\\naccording to RADOLAN were 55.4 mm in the LReg and\\n75.2 mm in the SReg. On the same day, high precipitation\\ntotals of more than 50 mm were also observed over larger\\nareas in the adjacent regions of Belgium and Luxembourg.\\nTogether with rain amounts of 20 to 50 mm already fallen on\\nthe previous day (see Fig. S2a), this resulted in 48 h rain sums\\nof more than 75 mm (Fig. S2b). Note that Saadi et al. (2022)\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\n\\n\\x0cS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 ﬂood event – Part 1\\n\\n533\\n\\nrecently pointed out an underestimation of RADOLAN for\\nthis particular event of about 15 % to 20 % compared to sta-\\ntion data.\\n\\nFor a ﬁrst climatological classiﬁcation of the precipitation\\nevent, return periods were calculated using the GPD with the\\nPOT method (see Sect. 2.6) based on 65 years of HYRAS\\ndata as reference. For this purpose, the 24 h precipitation to-\\ntals of RADOLAN were interpolated on the HYRAS grid.\\nThe rather large area with high precipitation totals is reﬂected\\nin high return periods (Fig. 3b) exceeding over 100 years.\\nEspecially in the southern part of the ﬁgure near the border\\nbetween Germany and Luxembourg, observed rainfall was\\nexceptionally high in a statistical context: on average, the re-\\nturn period was approximately 500 years (95 % conﬁdence\\ninterval 40 to 2 × 108 years) in LReg and 800 years (95 %\\nconﬁdence interval 50 to 4 × 107 years) in SReg. This is the\\nsame order of magnitudes as in other studies. For example,\\nKreienkamp et al. (2021) and Tradowsky et al. (2022) esti-\\nmated a return period of at least 400 years for an event with\\nsimilar magnitude and extent occurring anywhere in the area\\nin western Europe between the Alps and the Netherlands. Di-\\netze et al. (2022) showed that the sub-daily as well as daily\\nand multi-day precipitation totals at the DWD weather sta-\\ntion Weilerswist-Lommersum (Erft catchment) exceeded the\\n500-year return level. According to the KOSTRA classiﬁ-\\ncation of DWD (KOSTRA-DWD-2010R), 24 h totals also\\nexceeded the 100-year return level in a larger area between\\nCologne and the borders to Luxembourg and Belgium (see\\nFig. S4 including data description in the Supplement).\\n\\n3.1.2 Weather forecast analysis\\n\\nIn the following section, the predictability of the event is an-\\nalyzed based on weather forecasts by DWD and ECMWF\\n(see Sect. 2.1). The deterministic forecast runs of the DWD\\nICON-EU model show the potential for a widespread heavy\\nprecipitation event in the border region between western\\nGermany, eastern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the\\nNetherlands as early as 12 July 00:00 UTC (see Fig. S5).\\nWhile the affected area and intensity varies over the next\\nforecasts, the potential for an extraordinary event in this\\nregion remains. Speciﬁcally for the affected area (LReg),\\nhigh 24 h precipitation totals (within the range of the ob-\\nservations; see Sect. 3.1.1) were predicted more than 2 d\\n(from 12 July 00:00 UTC) ahead of the event (blue dots in\\nFig. 4a). The DWD ICON-D2 forecasts also captured the\\nmagnitude of the event right from of their ﬁrst initializa-\\ntion (13 July 06:00 UTC; red dots in Fig. 4a), as can also be\\nseen in the spatial distribution of the precipitation forecasts\\nby ICON-D2 and ICON-D2-EPS for different initialization\\ntimes (Fig. S6). They consistently depict high precipitation\\ntotals over a wide area around the border between NRW, RP,\\nBelgium, and Luxembourg, locally exceeding 150 mm d−1.\\nEspecially for the affected area, both ICON-EU and ICON-\\nD2 forecasts oscillate around the observed precipitation to-\\n\\ntals (Fig. 4a), with even slightly higher predicted totals com-\\npared to the observations for the initialization shortly ahead\\nof the start of the event. The DWD ICON-D2-EPS predic-\\ntions (gray box plots in Fig. 4a) clearly show that the closer\\nthey were initialized to the event, the more the uncertainty\\nof the prediction decreased. The predictions of the ECMWF-\\nEPS also indicated the possibility of an unusual event early\\non (Fig. 4b). EFI values (see Sect. 2.1) above 0.5 are ob-\\ntained from the forecasts initialized on 10 and 11 July 2021.\\nFrom 12 July on, also 2 d before the event, the EFI for 24 h\\nprecipitation exceeds values of 0.8, indicating a very high\\nprobability of occurrence of a very unusual or extreme event\\nin this region. The above results show that while the precise\\nprediction of the rainfall totals for the affected areas as only\\npossible a few hours in advance, the potential for a extraor-\\ndinary precipitation event in the region was given at least 2 d\\nin advance.\\n\\n3.2 Hydrological aspects\\n\\nIn this section, we discuss the hydrological aspects of the\\nevent, including antecedent conditions in the catchments,\\nriver water levels and streamﬂow, effects on reservoirs, and\\na comparison of observed peak values with statistical design\\nﬂoods. However, we did not estimate statistical return peri-\\nods of the July 2021 ﬂood for several reasons. The ﬁrst reason\\nis that during the event, many gauging stations were partly\\nor completely destroyed, and even if water level recordings\\nexisted, water level–discharge relations (W –Q relations) at\\nmany gauges were severely altered during the ﬂood due to\\ndynamical river bed changes or backwater effects from ﬂoat-\\ning debris trapped upstream of bridges (see Sect. 3.3). Fur-\\nthermore, the water levels observed during the ﬂood were of-\\nten all-time records exceeding existing W –Q relations. Re-\\nconstructing event discharge, the basis for a statistical treat-\\nment, is therefore a difﬁcult and still ongoing task, and the\\nvalues reported below should be interpreted as the best avail-\\nable to date but not as ﬁnal estimates. Nevertheless, and de-\\nspite considerable uncertainties, often the sheer magnitude of\\nthe estimates underline the exceptional nature of the event.\\n\\n3.2.1 Antecedent conditions\\n\\nAnalyzing major historical ﬂoods in Germany, Schröter et al.\\n(2015) found that they were triggered either by extensive\\nprecipitation events following a normal to dry period, or by\\nmoderate precipitation events following an exceptionally wet\\nperiod. This means that catchment preconditions – namely\\nsoil wetness – are a crucial factor for ﬂood occurrence\\nand/or magnitude. For the 30 d prior to the event, API values\\n(Sect. 2.2) quantiﬁed by RADOLAN data show a moderate\\nwet period in most of Germany (Fig. S7a). Widespread val-\\nues range between 20 and 60 mm, with spatial averages of\\n55.0 mm for LReg and 49.7 mm for SReg. This agrees with\\nJunghänel et al.

As a consequence, their ﬂood\\ndynamics were quite similar and we therefore discuss them\\ntogether here. In their headwaters (Fig. 6a, c, and e), with the\\nonset of rainfall (see Sect. 3.1.1), water levels started rising in\\nthe morning of 14 July (08:00–10:00 UTC) and reached peak\\nlevels in the evening (20:00–22:00 UTC). Within only 12 h,\\nwater levels rose by about 3 m at Kyll and Prüm and by more\\nthan 5 m at the Ahr. All peak values were clearly beyond the\\npeak ﬂows of a 100-year ﬂood event (H Q100), for Müsch\\neven by a factor of about 3 (Table 1). After the peak, water\\nlevels in the headwaters started gradually declining, and by\\naround midnight of the following day (15 July) the ﬂood had\\nended.\\n\\nAt the downstream gauges (Fig. 6b, d, and f), peak wa-\\nter levels were reached in the early morning of 15 July\\n(00:00 UTC at gauge Altenahr, 08:30 UTC at gauge Kordel,\\n05:30 UTC at gauge Prümzurlay). Like for the headwater\\ngauges, water levels rose dramatically within only 12 h: al-\\nmost 6 m at Kordel, almost 7 m at Prümzurlay, and almost\\n10 m at Altenahr. Likewise, the estimated peak ﬂows are all\\nclearly above the statistical H Q100 values, with a record fac-\\ntor of about 4 at gauge Altenahr (Table 1). Owing to its\\ndeeply incised topography, forcing settled areas into close\\nvicinity of the river and leaving very little ﬂoodplains for safe\\ninundation, the villages along the river Ahr were severely\\naffected by the ﬂood, including a large number of fatalities\\n(see Sect. 4). Another consequence of the steep terrain and\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n\\n\\x0c536\\n\\nS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 ﬂood event – Part 1\\n\\nconstricted conditions at the Ahr were high ﬂow velocities,\\nerosion, and transport of ﬂoating debris, causing substan-\\ntial blocking and backwater effects (see Sect. 3.3). The es-\\ntimated peak ﬂow of about 900 to 1000 m3 s−1 (Fig. 6b) cor-\\nresponds well with estimates of 1000 to 1200 m3 s−1 based\\non hydraulic considerations by Roggenkamp and Hergert\\n(2022). It is also noteworthy that while large historical\\nﬂoods (in 1804 and 1910) have been documented at the Ahr\\n(Roggenkamp and Herget, 2014a, b), only data from the\\ncontinuous records starting in 1973 were used to estimate\\nH Q100 values (see Part 2 for a detailed discussion).\\n\\n3.2.3 Erft river basin\\n\\nLike the rivers Ahr, Kyll, and Prüm, the river Erft originates\\nin the Eifel, but it drains northward towards its conﬂuence\\nwith the Rhine near the city of Düsseldorf (see Fig. 1). In\\nthe Erft headwater region, 130 to 150 mm of rain fell on\\n14 July, with highest intensities occurring between 10:00 and\\n19:00 UTC. As a consequence, the water level at headwa-\\nter gauge Schönau (Fig. 6g), for example, started rising at\\n07:00 UTC, reaching its peak at 18:50 UTC in the evening,\\nmore than 5 times larger than the statistical H Q100 of the\\ngauge. At gauge Bliesheim (Fig. 6h), 36 km downstream\\nof Schönau, water levels started rising about 6 h later, but\\n– due to the operation of the retention basins Eicherscheid\\nand Horchheim located in-between – reached its peak only\\nat 08:45 UTC on the following day. While the operation of\\nthe reservoirs delayed the peak somewhat, they were far too\\nsmall to signiﬁcantly reduce the ﬂood peak: at Bliesheim,\\nthe maximum discharge exceeded the statistical H Q100 by\\na factor of more than 7 (Table 1), which is even higher than\\nfor Schönau. In fact, the magnitude of the ﬂood not only ren-\\ndered ﬂood reduction by reservoir operation impossible, it\\neven posed a great threat to many retention basins in the re-\\ngion most affected. As a typical example, we brieﬂy sum-\\nmarize the course of events at retention basin Horchheim\\n(see Fig. 1). It was built in the 1980s and is operated by\\nthe Erftverband for downstream ﬂood protection. The reser-\\nvoir volume and outlet gates are designed for protection\\nfrom H Q100 = 58 m3 s−1, the design ﬂood for ensuring dam\\nstability is H Q10 000 = 90 m3 s−1. In the night from 14 to\\n15 July, water entering the reservoir exceeded any recorded\\nvalues. Between 02:00 and 05:00 UTC in the morning of\\n15 July, i.e., in only 3 h, total inﬂow exceeded twice the\\nentire retention volume. The peak inﬂow was estimated as\\nabout 390 m3 s−1, which is about 4 times the H Q10 000. As\\na consequence, and despite all ﬂood gates opened, the dam\\novertopped at 05:35 UTC, causing destruction of all service\\ninfrastructure and partial destruction of the dam by back-\\nward erosion (Erftverband, 2021). Similar situations were –\\namong many others – encountered at retention basins Eich-\\nerscheid and Niederberg and service water reservoir Stein-\\nbachtalsperre (all located in the Erft basin) and Urfttalsperre\\n(river Urft, see Fig. 1). For the latter, the design discharge for\\n\\ndam stability of H Q10 000 = 289 m3 s−1 was surpassed by a\\nfactor of more than about 1 on the morning of 15 July (es-\\ntimated peak ﬂow is about 320 m3 s−1), fortunately without\\ndam failure (Bung, 2021).\\n\\n3.2.4 Wupper river basin\\n\\nUnlike the above discussed river basins, the Wupper river\\nbasin is located east of the Rhine (see Fig. 1). It is charac-\\nterized by low mountain terrain and several reservoirs, most\\nof them operated by the Wupperverband. The largest reser-\\nvoir is the Wupper-Talsperre. It has an upstream basin size\\nof 212 km2 and an overall storage volume of 25.6 × 106 m3;\\nadditionally, 9.9 × 106 m3 are available for ﬂood retention.\\nGauge Hückeswagen (Table 1 and Fig. 6i) is just upstream\\nof the reservoir, and gauge Opladen (Table 1 and Fig. 6j)\\nis far downstream, close to the conﬂuence with the Rhine\\n(see Fig. 1). Just like in the Eifel region west of the Rhine,\\nthe rainfall event in the Wupper basin on 14 July was char-\\nacterized by high intensities, large sums, and large spa-\\ntial extent (see Fig. 3a): in an area larger than 1000 km2,\\n120 to 150 mm of rainfall were recorded within 24 h on\\n14 July. Even compared to point statistics, these totals ex-\\nceed 200-year return intervals (see Fig. 3b), in combina-\\ntion with its areal extent the return period is even more ex-\\ntreme and hard to quantify (cf. PART2). As a consequence,\\nwater levels and discharge at gauge Hückeswagen rose to\\nmagnitudes almost 3 times larger than the previously largest\\nrecorded ﬂood and the statistical 100-year ﬂood (Table 1).\\nAt about 15:00 UTC, the gauge was completely inundated\\nand data transfer stopped. Thanks to warnings by DWD, the\\nWupper-Talsperre water level was drawn down at increas-\\ning rates since 12 July, creating additional retention vol-\\nume prior to the ﬂood. Despite these measures, its maxi-\\nmum water level was reached and exceeded at 22:00 UTC\\non 14 July, and the ﬂood spillway was activated to pre-\\nvent dam failure. Overall, and largely thanks to the pre-\\nevent water level drawdown, the reservoir fulﬁlled its pro-\\ntection task by reducing the unprecedented maximum inﬂow\\nof about 230 to about 190 m3 s−1 downstream (Wupperver-\\nband, 2021). At the Wupper-Talsperre, like for the previously\\nmentioned reservoirs Horchheim and Urfttalsperre, the max-\\nimum inﬂow exceeded even the H Q10 000 = 168 m3 s−1 de-\\nsign discharge, here by a factor of about 1.3. Despite the mit-\\nigating effect of the reservoir operation, and largely owing\\nto the effect of the large intermediate catchment area, peak\\nwater levels and streamﬂow at downstream gauge Opladen\\nalso were the largest ever recorded, exceeding the statistical\\n100-year ﬂood by a factor of more than 2 (Table 1).\\n\\n3.2.5 Rivers in Belgium and Luxembourg\\n\\nFlooding in Belgium occurred mainly in the southeastern\\nparts, on tributaries to the river Meuse, originating from the\\nEifel and Ardennes region (see Fig. 1). Especially along the\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\n\\n\\x0cS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 ﬂood event – Part 1\\n\\n537\\n\\nrivers Ourthe (basin size 1850 km2), Amblève (1100 km2)\\nand Vesdre (700 km2), previously unobserved peak water\\nlevels and streamﬂow values were reached, leading to 39 fa-\\ntalities and vast damage to buildings and infrastructure (De-\\nwals et al., 2021). Rainfall amounts close to 200 mm in 24 h\\nwere observed in the region, which is far beyond the statis-\\ntical 200-year return period (Dewals et al., 2021). For ex-\\nample, peak ﬂow at the Ourthe river just upstream the Ves-\\ndre conﬂuence was estimated to be about 1100 m3 s−1, which\\nis about 50 % above the previously observed maximum and\\nabout 25 % above the statistical 100-year ﬂood. Along other\\nrivers such as the Vesdre, evidence from partial gauge obser-\\nvations (most were destroyed during the ﬂood) suggests that\\n100-year ﬂoods were exceeded by a factor of about 3 (De-\\nwals et al., 2021).\\n\\nIn Luxembourg, severe ﬂooding occurred mainly along the\\nrivers Alzette, Sur, and Our, and along tributaries in the east\\nand southeast of the Grand Duchy (see Fig. 1). As a result of\\nwidespread 24 h precipitation totals reaching 100 mm (Mete-\\noLux, 2021), streamﬂow surpassed the statistical H Q100 at\\n10 river gauges; at 15 gauges it was the highest ever recorded,\\nresulting in widespread inundations and evacuation (AGE,\\n2021).\\n\\n3.3 Hydro-morphodynamic processes\\n\\nThe July 2021 ﬂood in Germany demonstrated that ﬂood-\\ninduced alterations in the morphology of landscape, river\\nchannels, and urban areas have great potential to destruct and\\ndamage housing, farm land, industry, crucial infrastructure,\\nand natural areas (see also Sect. 4; cf. also Dewals et al.,\\n2021). Immediately after an extreme event, data on mor-\\nphology changes in the valleys are sparse and unstructured.\\nThe time required to reconstruct hydro-morphodynamic pro-\\ncesses with numerical models happening at\\nthis spatial\\nscale is not compatible with an immediate post-event sur-\\nvey. Therefore, our analysis and interpretation are based\\non a qualitative assessment that draws on photo and video\\nelements collected from social media, as well as histori-\\ncal reports, images, and topography. We complement in-\\nformation already advanced in other works on how hydro-\\nmorphodynamic aspects are related to an enhancement of\\nhazard in the July 2021 ﬂoods (i.e., Dietze et al., 2022), fo-\\ncusing more speciﬁcally on (i) hydrodynamic and geomor-\\nphic processes in the channel network; (ii) morphology (nat-\\nural or anthropic) channel network singularities; and (iii) an-\\nthropic modiﬁcation of the catchment.\\n\\n3.3.1 Fluvial morphology as a dynamic system\\n\\nIn the municipality of Rech (Ahrweiler district), for in-\\nstance, the erosion and collapse of the right bank of the river\\nAhr destructed houses and infrastructure (cf. cover photo\\nat Petermann, 2021). Another very visible morphological\\neffect was the destruction of gauging stations (e.g., Alte-\\n\\nnahr; see Sect. 3.2) by local scour, bank erosion, and col-\\nlapse, which hindered the hydrological monitoring and re-\\nconstruction of the event. In the municipality of Dernau (see\\nSect. 4.1 Fig. 10 for orientation), human-induced changes in\\nthe valley changed the response of the river network to ﬂoods\\nover time; while the peak ﬂood discharge estimated for the\\nJuly 2021 ﬂood was in the same order of magnitude as for the\\n1804 event (cf. Part 2 and Roggenkamp and Hergert, 2022),\\nthe ﬂood level in 2021 was about 2.4 m higher (Fig. 7a).\\nDernau is located on a relatively wide section of the Ahr\\nvalley; immediately downstream, the river becomes single-\\nthreaded and narrow for approximately 2 km, widening again\\njust upstream of the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. This\\ndownstream bottleneck makes Dernau naturally prone to wa-\\nter accumulation and consequent inundation due to back-\\nwater effects. Between 1804 and 2021, more precisely in\\nthe 1880s, the railroad of the Ahr valley (Ahrtalbahn) was\\nconstructed and four bridges were built precisely in the bot-\\ntleneck river reach, which narrowed even further the channel\\ncross-section. During the July 2021 ﬂood, these bridges were\\ndestroyed along with the Ahr valley railroad (Fig. 7b). From\\nthe post-event analysis, we may argue that the higher peak\\nwater level – compared to 1804 – were due to a combina-\\ntion of both (a) the anthropogenic morphology change of the\\nvalley geometry, more speciﬁcally of the river cross-section,\\nimposed by the construction of the railroad bridges, which in-\\ncreased the bottleneck effect; and (b) the probable damming\\nand clogging of the river cross-sections at the location of\\nthe bridges by the trapping of large-scale debris transported\\nfrom the upstream valley (in Fig. 7b) remains of this debris,\\nmainly wood, are visible). Large volumes of large-scale de-\\nbris, including wood; industrial components, such as vehicles\\nand caravans, bins and containers; and construction materi-\\nals were observed throughout the river channel network in\\nthe post-event survey. Most of this debris was nonexistent or\\nlimited in 1804.\\n\\n3.3.2 More than water: sediment and debris\\n\\nThe July 2021 event was a showcase of how the excess of\\nsediment reaching the river network, and changes in river\\nmorphology due to the excess of ﬂow energy to perform ge-\\nomorphic work, interact non-linearly with the ﬂood propa-\\ngation. In the post-event survey we observed, in all affected\\nvalleys with no exception, that river sections and streets were\\npartially and sometimes entirely dammed by organic and in-\\norganic large-scale debris, often with dimensions compara-\\nble to the cross-section available to the ﬂow (cf. tweet on\\nTwitter from NoeWehrtSich, 2021). Assuming that the trans-\\nport of large debris follows the same modes as described in\\nRuiz-Villanueva et al. (2019) for large wood, the post-events\\nimages taken at the river Ahr indicate that, at least for some\\nmoments during the event, the large debris was transported\\nin the so-called congested and hypercongested regimes, in\\nwhich the debris elements are constantly in contact and are\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\n\\nNat.

We believe that\\nthe magnitude of the overland and river ﬂows reported pre-\\nviously (see Sect. 3.2) corresponded to large periods when\\nthe ﬂow exceeding the threshold for recruitment of sediment\\nand debris, and that when the peak discharge occurred the\\nchannel network was already clogged with solid material.\\n\\n3.3.3 Natural and anthropogenic landscape\\n\\nsingularities\\n\\nIn a river catchment, many natural and anthropogenic sin-\\ngularities disrupt the continuity of the landscape and river\\nnetwork. The most visible anthropogenic singularities in val-\\nleys, which inﬂuence and are affected by ﬂoods, are bridges.\\nFekete and Sandholz (2021) refer to the destruction of\\n62 bridges, whereas BMI (2022) estimated that 103 bridges\\nwere damaged or completely destroyed during the July 2021\\nﬂood event, only in the Ahr valley. Several reasons can be\\npointed out for the bridge collapses, as in the two examples\\nin the Ahrweiler district (see Fig. 7b and c): foundation exca-\\nvation and scouring, impact and hydrodynamic action, lateral\\nerosion of the abutments, and bank failure.\\n\\nEphemeral morphology features such as channel section\\nblockage are provoked by the accumulation of sediments\\nand debris, and these occurred at several locations during\\nthe July 2021 ﬂood, as observed extensively in the survey\\nand shown in social media. The eventual destruction and\\ncollapse of these impounding incidents caused downstream\\n\\nﬂood bursts (cf. also Fekete and Sandholz, 2021) with extra\\ndebris-charged peak ﬂows traveling downstream as an abrupt\\nfront (with similar effects to dam break ﬂows).\\n\\nAn (anthropogenic) landscape fragility in the Erft catch-\\nment had unforeseen consequences (and excessive media ex-\\nposure): a mining pit as deep as 50 m and with an area of\\nroughly 25 ha, located northwest of the town of Erftstadt\\n(Erft catchment, Rhein-Erft-Kreis district). During the begin-\\nning of 15 July, the urban district of Blessem of the town of\\nErftstadt was inundated, and the ﬂood ﬂowed freely through\\nthe streets, roughly from south to north. The pathway of the\\nwater downstream through the town was along the natural\\nlandscape gradient and eventually into the pit through an ex-\\nisting depression on its south levee. This ﬂow pattern corre-\\nsponded remarkably to what the simulations from the ﬂood\\nhazard map produced by the district government of Cologne\\npreviewed for both cases: a ﬂood with a return period of\\n100 years and an extreme ﬂood (Bezirksregierung Köln,\\n2019). When the water started ﬂowing on the pit slope, an un-\\nexpected major process of retro dendritic (tree-shaped) ero-\\nsion occurred, which reached the urban district of Blessem\\nin 6 to 8 h (Fig. 8). Eight houses were destroyed and con-\\nsiderable damage was reported to infrastructure and other\\nbuildings and assets. During the night of 15 to 16 July, the\\ndendritic shape of the erosion reached the river Erft and redi-\\nrected it into the pit; the conﬁguration of the landscape dras-\\ntically changed within 1.5 d. A ﬂood attenuation side effect\\nwas observed once the river Erft was connected to the mining\\npit: the ﬂood volume was partially absorbed by the reservoir\\nformed by the pit. A valley bypass occurred through the road\\ntunnel in the municipality of Altenahr constructed in 1834.\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Blue arrow shows the river ﬂow direction.\\n\\nWhen the ﬂood in July 2021 reached a level higher than\\nthe western entrance of the road tunnel of the federal high-\\nway B267, the water started ﬂowing freely through it, by-\\npassing a 3 km meander of the river Ahr. Meanders generally\\ncontribute to peak ﬂow attenuation (Bufﬁn-Bélanger et al.,\\n2015); in this particular case we argue that the bypass re-\\nsulted in an increase (but non-signiﬁcant) in the downstream\\ndischarge. Considerable destruction was caused at the east-\\nern tunnel outlet, where massive scouring of the road and the\\nneighboring slope occurred. A scour erosion step of more\\nthan 4 m was created, through which the water passed as\\na waterfall. Furthermore, the bypassed ﬂow conditioned the\\nﬂow in the downstream river, inﬂuencing its morphology and\\ncreating new areas of deposition and erosion.\\n\\n3.3.4 3D hydrodynamic complex processes\\n\\nIn the municipality of Schuld (see Fig. 10 for orientation)\\nand in the urban district of Altenburg (municipality of Alte-\\nnahr), both located in a meandering region of the river Ahr,\\ncomplex 3D hydrodynamic processes with consequences for\\nﬂood propagation (as discussed in Bates, 2022) were ob-\\nserved. The southern part of the urban settlement of Schuld\\nis located on the left-hand side of the inner region of an\\nAhr bend, an expected deposition area (cf. Blanckaert and\\nde Vriend, 2003). During the July 2021 ﬂood, the ﬂow inun-\\ndated this area of the urban settlement. Water charged with\\nsediment and debris circulated through the streets, and the\\nsolid material deposited, with serious consequences for the\\nsecurity of the dwellers and buildings (see Fig. 9).\\n\\nIn the second case, the water over-topped the levee of the\\nriver Ahr and was directed towards an old meander on the\\nright-hand side riverbank, ﬂooding the southeast of the ur-\\nban district of Altenburg (see Fig. 11). The spreading of the\\nﬂow through what possibly is an abandoned oxbow lake may\\nhave contributed to an attenuation of the downstream peak\\nﬂow through the ﬂood lamination effect (not measured but\\nnot expected to be signiﬁcant in this case). Oxbow regions\\n\\nFigure 9.

In total, at least 180 people lost their\\nlives (see Table S2), 69 of them in the Ahrweiler district (RP)\\nalong the river Ahr, and over 800 people were seriously in-\\njured (BMI, 2022). The Ahr valley was the location affected\\nmost severely, with an estimated 17 000 out of 42 000 people\\nlosing most of their property (BMI, 2022). Due to gaps in the\\ninformation warning chains (cf. Fekete and Sandholz, 2021;\\nThieken et al., 2022) and no widespread evacuations, many\\npeople surprised by the fast rising ﬂoodwaters were unable\\nto get to safe places or underestimated the imminent dan-\\nger, respectively (e.g., attempting to save belongings from\\nthe basement).\\n\\nWhile the ﬂood was ongoing and during the ﬁrst days\\nand weeks thereafter, the overall situation on site was rel-\\natively uncertain, which posed a major problem for crisis\\nmanagement, emergency personnel, and the provision of re-\\nlief supplies. As part of CEDIM’s concept of FDAs (see\\nSect. 1), a ﬁrst rapid assessment of the situation on site was\\ncarried out within a few days after the event (cf. Schäfer\\net al., 2021) to obtain initial estimates of the inundation areas\\n(Sect. 4.1), the associated potential losses (Sect. 4.2), and fur-\\nther consequences such as rail and road damage and blocking\\n(Sect. 4.3).\\n\\n4.1 Estimation of inundation areas in a rapid context\\n\\nOne of the ﬁrst steps in rapid disaster analyses is to esti-\\nmate the event’s footprints and to identify affected areas.

The onset of the event started in the late hours of\\n14 July and lasted until 16 July (see Fig. 6). While the ﬂood-\\ning was still ongoing, live imagery (e.g., helicopters, drones)\\nand social media imagery (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) was man-\\nually collected and processed as part of the CEDIM FDA\\n(Sect. 2.4). Initially, it was unclear which towns and villages\\nwere ﬂooded and to what extent, and how severe the ﬂooding\\nmight be. This was not only the case for the Ahr valley, but\\nalso for most other affected regions such as along the river\\nErft. River gauge stations only provided limited information\\nabout the actual water level (destroyed gauges, see Sect. 3.2).\\n\\nIn addition to the mentioned visual material above,\\nSentinel-1 imagery (see Sect. 2.4) and analyses of automatic\\nprocedures by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches\\nZentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR, 2021) were inte-\\ngrated into the analyses (from 15 July) to identify further\\nﬂooded areas. However, one constraint was that Sentinel-\\n1’s automated procedure is sensitive to topography and,\\nfor example, often identiﬁed hillslopes as inundation ar-\\neas. Nonetheless, the information was an additional proxy\\nto identify ﬂooded areas, especially for regions without\\navailable photos or videos. News media focused mainly on\\nseverely affected places such as the town of Bad Neuenahr-\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

In some cases, this gap was closed\\nby private footage, but this was not always the case.\\n\\nOn 17 July, Sentinel-2 imagery was made available, allow-\\ning further ﬂooded areas to be identiﬁed despite some cloud\\ncover and conﬁrming previous ﬁndings. However, due to the\\nlow resolution of the imagery, manual assessment was nec-\\nessary, for example by comparing the imagery with topog-\\nraphy data to differentiate between ﬂooded and muddy ar-\\neas. One problem was that the mud extended to roads, due\\nto trafﬁc and rain, that were not ﬂooded. In addition, some\\nmuddy roads were also caused by downhill water streams.\\nFurthermore, from 19 July, ﬁrst assessments by the Coper-\\nnicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS, 2021) were\\nadded, which were similar but showed gaps as well.\\n\\nFigure 10 provides an overview of the ﬁnal product for\\nthe Ahr valley, where about 17 km2 of ﬂooded area was\\nmapped between the two municipalities of Antweiler and\\nSinzig (distance around 34 km), excluding areas for which\\nno image data were available. Zoomed in, Fig. 11 com-\\npared exemplary different assessment products of the in-\\nundation area for the river loop near the municipality of\\nAltenahr (red box in Fig. 10). For this speciﬁc region\\nnear Altenahr, photos highly supported the reconstruction\\nof the inundation area (e.g., see tweet on Twitter: https://\\ntwitter.com/WxNB_/status/1415629704472760324, last ac-\\ncess: 13 November 2022). It can be clearly seen that purely\\nsatellite-based (automated) products based on Sentinel-1\\n(in yellow; DLR, 2021), which were already available on\\n15/16 July, detected signiﬁcantly too less ﬂood areas. The\\ntwo versions of CEMS (2021, from 19 July and in a post-\\nprocessed version from 11 August; both in red) are similar\\ncompared to our results (in blue), but these products also\\nfailed to detect all inundation areas in detail. A limitation\\nof our technique is that areas, for which no photos or video\\nsequences were available, may have ﬂaws. In addition, our\\nareas are deﬁned by inundation area polygons and are thus\\nnot street-level accurate. In contrast, the EMSR model has a\\nmuch higher level of detail down to the street level. Despite\\nthe lack of high quality satellite data and the exclusive use\\nof social media imagery and early Sentinel satellite imagery,\\nour inundation areas, which were created within 2 d, stands\\nup to long-term assessments in terms of quality.\\n\\n4.2 Rapid loss estimation and further loss statistics\\n\\nBased on the rapid quantiﬁcation of the mapped inunda-\\ntion areas (Sect. 4.1), a ﬁrst loss estimation was carried out\\nimmediately after the ﬂood (within 1 week; Schäfer et al.,\\n2021) using the loss models (Sect. 4.2) available in CEDIM.\\nThe modeling was applied to the whole of Germany; dam-\\nage proportion for Saxony and Bavaria, however, was only\\nabout 1 %. Damage was estimated to (a) damage to private\\nassets (including household goods), EUR 4.4 to 13.0 billion;\\n(b) damage to commercial, industrial, and other buildings,\\n\\nEUR 1.8 to 3.9 billion; and (c) damage to infrastructure,\\nEUR 4.7 to 12 billion (each based on capital stock portions).\\nThis results in total estimated damage of EUR 11 to 29 bil-\\nlion (as of 21 July 2021). However, it must be taken into ac-\\ncount that the ﬂooded areas represent only a part of the total\\naffected area, so that the extrapolation of the damaged area\\nwas associated with high uncertainty at the time.\\n\\nShortly after a disaster occurs, there is usually consider-\\nable uncertainty about the level of damage, so that such sim-\\npliﬁed methods are reasonable to provide timely loss esti-\\nmations. In the case of the river Ahr, for example, this was\\nnecessary because no precise ﬂood levels were initially avail-\\nable. Subsequently, these assessments were continuously im-\\nproved – whenever new satellite products or analysis tech-\\nniques became available for enhanced damage assessment.\\nAs a result, since summer 2021, various loss assessments\\nhave been made by both policy makers and the insurance in-\\ndustry (insurance associations, reinsurers, catastrophe mod-\\neling company), selectively compiled in Table S2. At the end\\nof 2021, the German Insurance Association (Gesamtverband\\nder Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft, GDV) estimated in-\\nsured losses for the July 2021 ﬂood event at EUR 8.2 bil-\\nlion in Germany alone and EUR 11 billion for all affected\\ncountries (GDV, 2021). However, only about 37 % to 47 %\\nof residential buildings were insured against ﬂoods, making\\nthe total damage signiﬁcantly higher. In addition, infrastruc-\\nture was massively affected (see also Sect. 4.3).\\n\\nThe German government estimated the total ﬂood damage\\nat EUR 32.05 billion, with 57 % of the damage attributable\\nto RP and 41.5 % to NRW; the remainder is attributable to\\ndamage in Bavaria and Saxony (based on the EU solidar-\\nity fund application of the German government within the\\nﬁnal report from March 2022; BMI, 2022). These damage\\nestimates include reconstruction costs compared to some of\\nthe damage-only estimates in Table S2. However, it must be\\ntaken into account that by the time of writing it is still un-\\nclear what the ﬁnal reconstruction costs and the associated\\ndamage costs will actually be.\\n\\nMost reinsurance companies currently use the GDV or\\nGerman government estimations, both of which are closely\\naligned (depending on the exact deﬁnitions). Based on our\\nnatural hazard database CATDAT (Sect. 4.2), this event is\\none of the two largest events for natural hazards damage in\\nEurope in the last 43 years (after the 1980 Irpinia earthquake\\nin Italy) and one of the ﬁve largest in general. The difference\\nbetween book value damage, replacement costs, and recon-\\nstruction costs has yet to be determined and will likely be\\nidentiﬁed by follow-up analyses, meaning that the ﬁnal eco-\\nnomic damage value for comparison with other past disasters\\nis not known at this point.\\n\\n4.3 Affected rail and road infrastructure\\n\\nThe ﬂood hit both the federal states of NRW and RP heavily\\nconcerning the transport and trafﬁc sectors (cf. Koks et al.,\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-525-2023\\n\\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 525–551, 2023\\n\\n\\x0c542\\n\\nS. Mohr et al.: The July 2021 ﬂood event – Part 1\\n\\n2022; Szymczak et al., 2022), both of which are classiﬁed as\\ncritical infrastructures. Most of the disruptions regarding rail\\nand road occurred directly after the event. In the Ahr valley\\nalone, an estimated 103 bridges were damaged or completely\\ndestroyed (cf. BMI, 2022). On 15 July 2021, 4 % of the to-\\ntal road trafﬁc reports issued by the police in RP and NRW\\n(Sect. 2.5) were directly related to the ﬂood event. Given the\\nlarge size of the two states and a generally high number of\\ntrafﬁc reports, and since this does not include indirect effects\\nsuch as trafﬁc jams, this can be considered a high percent-\\nage. In total, 39 road sections and 33 rail lines were affected.\\nThis decreased to 1.5 % on 23 July (15 rail lines, 15 road sec-\\ntions), but changed little until 31 July (11 rail lines, 11 road\\nsections). At the end of August 2021, 1 % of total trafﬁc re-\\nports issued in the two federal states was related to the ﬂood\\nevent. The number of disruptions in rail trafﬁc decreased only\\nmarginally until the end of September, while in road trafﬁc\\nthere were only two reports related to the ﬂood. The fact that\\nthere were still signiﬁcantly more rail than road disruptions\\nremaining in fall suggests that repairing rail infrastructure is\\nmore time-consuming than repairing road infrastructure. In\\nNRW alone, around 600 km of railroad tracks were affected\\n(Deutsche Bahn, 2021). When comparing trafﬁc affected by\\nthe July 2021 ﬂood with the situation of past ﬂood events,\\nfor example the 2013 European ﬂoods (Thieken et al., 2016),\\nthe total number of disruptions for both rail and road traf-\\nﬁc was much lower in 2021. This is likely due to the rather\\nlocal scale of the ﬂood event in 2021 as compared to 2013,\\nwhere the ﬂood affected a major part of eastern Germany.\\nAbout twice as many districts were affected by rail disrup-\\ntions as compared to road disruptions (see Fig. S8a). One\\npossible explanation is that disruptions in train connections\\nusually affect a longer section of track, while disruptions on\\nthe road affect shorter segments. Figure S8b shows that long-\\nterm disruptions (> 25 d, equaling to 22 % of the total disrup-\\ntions) mainly affected rail infrastructure (blue) in compari-\\nson to road infrastructure (yellow; as of mid-October 2021).\\nRegional trains (i.e., Regionalbahn, RB; Regional-Express,\\nRE; S-Bahn, S) were especially affected by long-term dam-\\nage, whereas on the road especially the highways A1 and\\nA61 were impacted. In mid-October 2021, 30 km of high-\\nways were still completely blocked, which equals 23 % of the\\nroads blocked directly after the ﬂooding (Schmitz, 2021). Re-\\ngarding rail infrastructure, experts struggle to give an estima-\\ntion on how long the reconstruction will take. In November,\\nDB issued an update on the post-ﬂood reconstruction work\\n(SPIEGEL, 2021). First important connecting lines, e.g., on\\nthe Ahr valley railroad (Ahrtalbahn) have already been re-\\nopened; however, the reconstruction of further sections may\\ntake several years (cf. Szymczak et al., 2022).\\n\\n5 Synopsis\\n\\nThe severe July 2021 ﬂood with more than 180 fatalities was\\nthe result of the superposition and interaction of different\\nmechanisms and processes on a wide range of temporal and\\nspatial scales. In the four weeks before the ﬂood, the region\\nof main interest was affected by a high number of rain events,\\nleading to moderate soil moisture conditions and thus limited\\ninﬁltration capacity (see Fig. 12). During a similar period,\\npersistent atmospheric blocking with corresponding high so-\\nlar insulation over the Baltic Sea resulted in unusual high\\nSST anomalies of up to 8 K compared to the climatological\\nmean. This allowed considerable amounts of water to evap-\\norate, which served as a major moisture source for the pre-\\ncipitation. According to our trajectory analysis, the easterly\\nﬂow on the northern ﬂank of the low-pressure system Bernd\\ntransported these moist air masses to the affected region.\\n\\nTwo days before the ﬂood, on 12 July, a quasi-stationary\\nanticyclone located over northeastern Europe blocked the\\nupper-level trough associated with the low pressure system\\nBernd. As a result, Bernd and the associated frontal system\\nmoved very slowly westward toward the region of main in-\\nterest. A slow propagating low with high moisture loading\\noften results in localized large rain accumulations. At least\\n2 d ahead of the ﬂood, the speciﬁc synoptic setting and the\\nresulting rain ﬁelds were predicted well (within the range\\nof the observations) by the operational deterministic (ICON-\\nEU) and the ensemble (ECMWF) model runs. ECMWF’s ex-\\ntreme forecast index (EFI) indicated a very high occurrence\\nprobability of an extreme event (Fig. 12).\\n\\nBecause of Bernd’s slow propagation and a rain ﬁeld ori-\\nentation nearly parallel to the propagation direction, high rain\\ntotals starting in the early morning hours on 14 July affected\\na large area during approximately 15 h (Fig. 12). In addition,\\nembedded convection further intensiﬁed the predominantly\\nstratiform precipitation on the local-scale. According to our\\nextreme value statistics, the observed totals of up to 150 mm\\ncorrespond to return periods of more than 500 years. Com-\\nbined with the steep slopes of the Ahr and other river valleys\\nin the region and the almost saturated soils, the rainfall sup-\\nported rapid rainfall-runoff transformation by overland ﬂow\\nthrough inﬁltration and saturation excess.\\n\\nBecause of heavy rain lasting several hours over an ex-\\ntended area, the water levels in the headwaters that originate\\nfrom the central Eifel plateau (Ahr, Kyll, and Prüm rivers)\\nrose very rapidly to unprecedented heights on 14 and 15 July\\n(Fig. 12). All peak values were clearly beyond the peak dis-\\ncharges of a 100-year ﬂood event, at some gauges even by a\\nfactor of more than ﬁve. At the downstream gauges, peak wa-\\nter levels were reached some hours later, in the early morn-\\ning of 15 July, but with an even more dramatic increase. Esti-\\nmated peak ﬂows were all clearly above the statistical H Q100\\nvalues, with a record factor of around seven at the gauge\\nBliesheim (Erft).

Compa-\\nrably dramatic rises and peak ﬂows, however, were also re-\\nported east of the Rhine (Wupper river basin), and for several\\nrivers in Belgium and Luxembourg, where rainfall amounts\\nclose to 200 mm in 24 h were observed.\\n\\nThe magnitude of the ﬂood not only rendered ﬂood reduc-\\ntion by reservoir operation impossible, it even posed a great\\nthreat to many retention basins in the region most affected. At\\nretention basin Horchheim (river Erft), for example, the peak\\ninﬂow was estimated to be about four times higher than the\\nstatistical H Q10 000. Although all ﬂoodgates were opened,\\nthe dam still overﬂowed, causing severe damage to all service\\ninfrastructure and partial destruction of the dam by backward\\nerosion. Similar situations were observed at several other re-\\ntention basins.\\n\\nVarious local-scale hydro-morphodynamic processes that\\ncondition the valley response to the ﬂood, changes in the\\nvalley morphology, and sediment and debris transport con-\\ntributed to the extraordinary water levels in some regions.\\nHillslope denudation and widespread landslides observed in\\nsome areas yielded an excess of sediment in the river chan-\\nnels network, which in turn contributed to changes in mor-\\nphology. Flood levels increased in response to extra resis-\\ntance to the ﬂow and because of partial or complete block-\\ning of cross-sections available to the ﬂow. Other effects rel-\\nevant for the high ﬂood levels are anthropogenic morphol-\\nogy changes in the river cross-section attributable to railroad\\nbridges (increased bottleneck effect) and probable damming\\nand clogging of the river cross-sections at the bridges at-\\ntributable to the trapping of debris transported from the up-\\nstream valley. Further, it can be assumed that a larger number\\nof assets and industrial components caused a higher volume\\nof debris available for recruitment in the upstream valley. All\\nthese effects, observed at several locations, may explain why\\nthe maximum water level of the 2021 ﬂood at several sites\\nwas higher (e.g., Dernau by 2.4 m) compared to the 1804\\n\\nﬂood, although the estimated peak ﬂood discharges were in\\nthe same order of magnitude.\\n\\nAs part of CEDIM’s FDA task force, we started to sys-\\ntematically assess inundation areas almost for the entire Ahr\\ncatchment on 14 July, while the ﬂooding was still ongoing\\n(Fig. 12). Rapid remote sensing of the inundation area is an\\nessential component for estimating the impact of a disaster\\nand for early response management to prioritize emergency\\nresponse. For the analyses, live imagery from helicopters or\\ndrones and social media (e.g., YouTube, Twitter) were man-\\nually collected and processed. From 15/16 July, Sentinel-1\\nimagery and ﬁrst analyses of automatic procedures by DLR\\nwere available and integrated into the analyses to identify\\nfurther ﬂooded areas. From 17 July, Sentinel-2 imagery was\\nused to identify further ﬂooded areas despite partial cloud\\ncover. On 18 July, the ﬁrst ﬁnal version of estimated inunda-\\ntion areas was available. A qualitative comparison with other\\nproducts of inundation areas (e.g., EMSR517_v3, CEMS,\\n2021; SGD, 2021) is at a similar level to our near-real-time\\nestimation.\\n\\nIn the Ahr valley alone, more than 100 bridges were dam-\\naged or completely destroyed. On 15 July 2021, about 4 %\\nof the total road trafﬁc reports issued by the police in RP\\nand NRW were directly related to the ﬂood event. In NRW,\\naround 600 km of railroad tracks were affected. In general,\\nabout twice as many districts suffered from by rail disrup-\\ntions – with longer required reconstruction times compared\\nto road disruptions. Based on the rapid quantiﬁcation of the\\nmapped inundation areas, we carried out a ﬁrst loss esti-\\nmation using CEDIM’s loss model 1 week after the onset\\nof the ﬂood (Fig. 12). Damage to private assets was esti-\\nmated between EUR 4.4 and 13.0 billion, damage to com-\\nmercial, industrial, and other buildings between EUR 1.8 and\\n3.9 billion, and damage to infrastructure between EUR 4.7\\nand 12 billion, thus in total EUR 11 to 29 billion.

The amount is thus at the upper end of our near-\\nreal-time estimations.\\n\\nHowever, as such very rare events are responsible for\\nthe greatest number of fatalities and the highest eco-\\nnomic losses, our still insufﬁcient knowledge need to be\\nfurther improved across disciplines through more dedi-\\ncated research.\\n\\n6 Discussion and conclusions\\n\\nThe July 2021 ﬂood in western Germany and neighboring\\nregions was one of the ﬁve most severe and expensive catas-\\ntrophes related to natural hazards in Europe in the last half\\ncentury. More than 180 people lost their lives, and well over\\n10 000 buildings were damaged. Numerous critical infras-\\ntructures, such as power and water supply networks, bridges,\\nrailway tracks, and roads, were partly or completely de-\\nstroyed, which signiﬁcantly hampered relief deliveries and\\nclean-up work in the affected area. According to estimates\\nfrom the German government in March 2022, the total dam-\\nage in Germany alone amounts to EUR 32 billion (BMI,\\n2022), although it is still unclear how high the ﬁnal recon-\\nstruction costs will actually be.\\n\\nAs part of CEDIM’s Forensic Disaster Analyses (FDAs)\\nin near-real-time, an interdisciplinary team of scientists in-\\nvestigated this severe ﬂood event from different perspectives.\\nBased upon analyses of available model and observational\\ndata and supplemented by own simulations and assessments,\\nthis paper has examined the complex interactions among me-\\nteorological, hydrological, hydraulic, and geomorphological\\nprocesses and mechanisms that led to the extraordinary ﬂood.\\nAnother objective of this study was to demonstrate how addi-\\ntional information immediately after a disaster can generate\\nadded value for early response management (e.g., prioritiza-\\ntion of emergency measures), and how helpful these ﬁrst as-\\nsessments can be. Some of the analyses presented here were\\nconducted while the ﬂood was still ongoing – such as the\\nestimation of inundation areas from photographs, video se-\\nquences, and satellite overﬂights, and derived damage assess-\\nments. Furthermore, we estimated the impact in terms of traf-\\nﬁc disruptions and economic losses. Not only was the ﬂood’s\\nintensity decisive in the outcomes, but also the failure of the\\nwarning chain (Fekete and Sandholz, 2021; Thieken et al.,\\n2022; DKKV, 2022). The population was informed too late\\nor insufﬁciently about the extent of the imminent disaster de-\\nspite the fact that both deterministic and ensemble weather\\nforecasts issued, for example by DWD and ECMWF, pre-\\ndicted extreme rain totals and signiﬁed the potential of a very\\nunusual or extreme event at least 2 d before the ﬂood.\\n\\nBased upon our analyses, we draw the following conclu-\\nsions and make some recommendations to improve the esti-\\nmation of ﬂood hazard and risk:\\n\\n– Catastrophic events such as the July 2021 ﬂood occur\\nvery rarely, mainly because the relevant processes and\\nmechanisms on different spatial and temporal scales\\nthat amplify such an event must interact optimally.\\n\\n– In recent years,\\n\\nthe forecasting skill of numerical\\nweather models has improved signiﬁcantly due to in-\\ncreasing computational power, better observations and\\nassimilation schemes, advanced model physics, higher\\nresolution, and larger ensembles (Bauer et al., 2015).\\nWhile the meteorological potential for an extraordinary\\nevent in the region was identiﬁed in the DWD and\\nECMWF forecasts at least 2 d in advance, it remains\\ndifﬁcult to communicate the probabilistic nature of fore-\\ncasts, in particular with respect to extremes, to users and\\nthe general public. Here, we have used the EFI based on\\nECMWF forecasts as a simple and intuitive metric that\\nsuccessfully gave indications for a potentially harmful\\nevent already several days before it occurred. We ad-\\nvertise usage of such concepts for other cases and fore-\\ncasting systems to facilitate communication. However,\\na robust assessment of the model climate and predicted\\nextremes as a reference is necessary to compute the\\nEFI, which requires expensive re-forecasts. Currently,\\nECMWF is one of few operational centers internation-\\nally that provides such a metric operationally.\\n\\n– River gauges are a crucial source of information in the\\nevent of a ﬂood. These gauges should be installed in\\nsuch a way that they also function reliably in the event\\nof an extreme ﬂood. Therefore, particular care should\\nbe taken when replacing the river gauges lost during the\\nrecent ﬂood to avoid similar issues in the future. The\\nuse of video analysis can be an alternative, allowing dis-\\ntance observation of ﬂood levels and inference of ﬂood\\ndischarges with fairly good results (Detert et al., 2017).\\n\\n– The ﬂood hazard (e.g., a 100-year ﬂood level) typi-\\ncally used as a design basis for ﬂood protection is cur-\\nrently underestimated when historical severe ﬂoods are\\nnot considered (cf. Roggenkamp and Hergert, 2022). In\\nthe case of the Ahr catchment, historical analyses have\\nshown that events comparable to the July 2021 ﬂood had\\noccurred already in 1804 and 1910, but only data from\\nthe continuous records (e.g., for gauge Altenahr start-\\ning in 1946) were used to estimate H Q100 values. Fur-\\nthermore, when analyzing and interpreting hydrologi-\\ncal data, it is important to consider that infrastructures,\\nlandscape occupation, and ﬂood protection measures of-\\nten change considerably with direct consequences on\\nﬂood risk over timescales shorter than the return period\\nconsidered for ﬂood emergency management.\\n\\n– By interacting with the landscape and network morphol-\\nogy of river channels, ﬂowing water enhances a ﬂood’s\\n\\nNat.

Relevant effects include (a) the\\nincluding\\noccurrence of extreme landscape erosion,\\nrapidly developing rivulets and landslides; (b) rapidly\\nevolving erosion and scour processes in the channel net-\\nwork and urban space; (c) recruitment of large-scale de-\\nbris from the natural landscape and urban landscape;\\n(d) deposition and clogging of bottlenecks in the chan-\\nnel network with eventual collapse; (e) possible inter-\\nsection of the ﬂow with landscape anthropogenic or nat-\\nural singularities; and (f) interaction with vegetation.\\nNone of these aspects are considered in the current prac-\\ntice of ﬂood hazard modeling, which leads to an under-\\nestimation of the actual risk (cf. also Dietze et al., 2022).\\nWe suggest an update of the ﬂoods directive, which\\nshould require that ﬂood hazard and risk assessments\\ninclude a heuristic hydro-morphodynamic approach that\\nconsiders the landscape and network of river channels,\\nincluding sediment transport and morphology changes\\n(Nones, 2019).\\n\\n– The near-real-time analyses carried out within the frame\\nof CEDIM’s FDA task force (Schäfer et al., 2021)\\ndemonstrated that it is possible to meaningfully identify\\na large part of the ﬂooded area from rapidly available\\nground data (photos, video sequences) in near-real-time\\nduring or after an event and thus generate valuable in-\\nformation for disaster management. A systematic ﬂy-\\nover of the affected areas using drones or similar – as is\\ncurrently being developed as part of a DLR pilot project\\n(DLR, 2022) – would be highly desirable. Such results,\\nmade available to authorities or relevant stakeholders,\\ncan help to get a quick and better overview of the overall\\nsituation in order to assess the damage more quickly and\\nto respond more appropriately in the aftermath of catas-\\ntrophic events. This helps to mitigate associated adverse\\neffects.\\n\\n– The impacts of extreme hydro-meteorological events\\nalso depend upon the way both authorities and individu-\\nals respond to predicted extremes and whether they take\\nappropriate action (e.g., securing valuable assets and\\ncritical infrastructure, evacuations). Operational hydro-\\nlogical forecasts in Germany, however, currently mainly\\nonly provide forecasts of streamﬂow and water levels at\\ngauges. To be as prepared as possible for upcoming ex-\\ntreme events, accurate predictions of both their physi-\\ncal characteristics and expected impacts on society and\\nthe built and natural environment are essential (Taylor\\net al., 2018; Merz et al., 2020; WMO, 2020). Impact-\\nbased forecasting that incorporates exposure, vulnera-\\nbility, and social systems in addition to the hazard has\\ngreat potential to reduce damage and increase resilience\\nsubstantially. The feasibility of this has recently been\\ndemonstrated by Apel et al. (2022), who used a sim-\\npliﬁed hydrodynamic ﬂood model to retroactively in-\\ncorporate spatially explicit information (such as inun-\\n\\ndation area, depths, and ﬂow velocities) based on pre-\\ndicted gauge discharges or water levels into current hy-\\ndrological forecasting systems for the July 2021 ﬂood.\\nThis provides real-time information on the expected ex-\\ntent of ﬂooding and its impacts. By implementing the\\nmodel on graphical processing units, simulation times\\nare within the range required for operational ﬂood warn-\\ning.\\n\\nPART2 of the paper (Ludwig et al., 2022) puts the\\nJuly 2021 ﬂood in historical context. This is accomplished\\nnot only by statistical analysis of observational data, but\\nalso by incorporating a large ensemble of regional climate\\nsimulations (comprising 12 000 years; cf. Ehmele et al.,\\n2020, 2022). The second focus of PART2 is to examine how\\nthe precipitation causing the ﬂood event could unfold in the\\ncontext of climate change. The related analysis is based on\\na storyline approach using a series of pseudo global warm-\\ning experiments and on a conventional ensemble of future\\nclimate projections.\\n\\nCode and data availability.
