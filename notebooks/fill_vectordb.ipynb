    "brief communication provides an overview of the impacts to\n",
    "large-scale critical infrastructure systems and how recovery\n",
    "has progressed. The results show that Germany and Belgium\n",
    "were particularly affected, with many infrastructure assets\n",
    "severely damaged or completely destroyed. Impacts range\n",
    "from completely destroyed bridges and sewage systems, to\n",
    "severely damaged schools and hospitals. We find that (largescale)\n",
    "risk assessments, often focused on larger (river) flood\n",
    "events, do not find these local, but severe, impacts due to critical\n",
    "infrastructure failures. This may be the result of limited\n",
    "availability of validation material. As such, this brief communication\n",
    "not only will help to better understand how critical\n",
    "infrastructure can be affected by flooding, but also can be\n",
    "used as validation material for future flood risk assessments.\n",
    "1 Introduction\n",
    "In mid-July 2021, a persistent low-pressure system caused\n",
    "extreme precipitation in parts of the Belgian, German and\n",
    "Dutch catchments of the Meuse and Rhine rivers. This led\n",
    "to record-breaking water levels and severe flooding (Mohr\n",
    "et al., 2022). Comparable heavy precipitation events in this\n",
    "area have never been registered in most of the affected areas\n",
    "before (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). The German states most affected\n",
    "include Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz), with\n",
    "damage to the Ahr River valley (Ahrtal), several regions in\n",
    "the Eiffel National Park, to the city of Trier. Flooding in\n",
    "Belgium was concentrated in the Vesdre River valley (districts\n",
    "of Pepinster, Ensival and Verviers), the Meuse River\n",
    "valley (Maaseik, Liége), the Gete River valley (Herk-de-Stad\n",
    "and Halen) and southeast Brussels (Wavre). The Netherlands\n",
    "experienced flooding, mostly concentrated in the southern\n",
    "district of Limburg. In total, at least 220 casualties have\n",
    "been reported, with insured loss estimates of approximately\n",
    "EUR 150 million–EUR 250 million in the Netherlands (Verbond\n",
    "voor Verzekeraars, 2022), EUR 2.2 billion in Belgium\n",
    "(Assuralia, 2022) and EUR 8.2 billion (GDV, 2022)\n",
    "in Germany. The event caused major damages to residential\n",
    "and commercial structures and to many critical infrastructure\n",
    "(CI) assets. Not only vital functions for first responders\n",
    "were affected (e.g. hospitals, fire departments), but also railways,\n",
    "bridges and utility networks (e.g. water and electricity\n",
    "supply) were severely damaged, expecting to take months to\n",
    "years to fully rebuild.\n",
    "CI is often considered to be the backbone of a wellfunctioning\n",
    "society (Hall et al., 2016), which is particularly\n",
    "eminent during natural hazards and disasters. For instance,\n",
    "failure of electricity or telecommunication services immediately\n",
    "causes disruptions in the day-to-day functioning of people\n",
    "and businesses, including those outside the directly affected\n",
    "area. Despite the (academic) agreement that failure of\n",
    "infrastructure systems may cause (large-scale) societal disruptions\n",
    "(Garschagen and Sandholz, 2018; Hallegatte et al.,\n",
    "2019; Fekete and Sandholz, 2021), empirical evidence on the\n",
    "impacts of extreme weather events on these systems is still\n",
    "Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n",
    "3832 E. E. Koks et al.: Flood impacts to infrastructure\n",
    "limited. This brief communication provides an overview of\n",
    "the observed flood impacts to large-scale infrastructure systems\n",
    "during the 2021 mid-July western European flood event\n",
    "and how reconstruction of these large-scale systems has progressed.\n",
    "Next, we highlight how some of these observations\n",
    "compare to academic modelling approaches. We conclude\n",
    "with suggestions on moving forward in CI risk modelling,\n",
    "based on the lessons learned from this extreme event.\n",
    "2 Critical infrastructure impacts\n",
    "2.1 Transport infrastructure\n",
    "In Germany, road and railway infrastructure was severely\n",
    "damaged as documented exemplarily in Fig. 1. Cost estimates\n",
    "reach up to EURO2 billion Euro (MDR, 2021). More\n",
    "than 130 km of motorways were closed directly after the\n",
    "event, of which 50 km were still closed two months later,\n",
    "with an estimated repair cost of EUR100 million (Hauser,\n",
    "2021). Of the 112 bridges in the flooded 40 km of the Ahr\n",
    "valley (Rhineland-Palatinate), 62 bridges were destroyed,\n",
    "13 were severely damaged and only 35 were in operation\n",
    "a month after the flood event (MDR, 2021). Over 74 km\n",
    "of roads, paths and bridges in the Ahr valley have been\n",
    "(critically) damaged. In some cases, repairs are expected to\n",
    "take months to years (Zeit Online, 2021). For example, major\n",
    "freeway sections, including parts of the A1 motorway,\n",
    "were closed until early 2022 (24Rhein, 2022). In addition,\n",
    "about 50 000 cars were damaged, causing insurance claims of\n",
    "some EUR 450 million (ADAC, 2021). The German railway\n",
    "provider Deutsche Bahn expects asset damages of around\n",
    "EUR 1.3 billion. Among other things, 180 level crossings,\n",
    "almost 40 signal boxes, over 1000 catenary and signal masts,\n",
    "and 600 km of tracks were destroyed, as well as energy supply\n",
    "systems, elevators and lighting systems (MDR, 2021).\n",
    "As of 11 April 2022, 14 of the affected rail stretches are\n",
    "fully functional again. The less damaged stretches were functional\n",
