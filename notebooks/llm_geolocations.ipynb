      "Chunk text [1]: Abstract. Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were hit by extreme precipitation and ﬂooding in July 2021. This brief communication provides an overview of the impacts to large-scale critical infrastructure systems and how recovery has progressed. The results show that Germany and Belgium were particularly affected, with many infrastructure assets severely damaged or completely destroyed. Impacts range from completely destroyed bridges and sewage systems, to severely damaged schools and hospitals. We ﬁnd that (large-scale) risk assessments, often focused on larger (river) ﬂood events, do not ﬁnd these local, but severe, impacts due to critical infrastructure failures. This may be the result of limited availability of validation material. As such, this brief communication not only will help to better understand how critical infrastructure can be affected by ﬂooding, but also can be used as validation material for future ﬂood risk assessments.\n",

Flooding in Belgium was concentrated in the Vesdre River valley (districts of Pepinster, Ensival and Verviers), the Meuse River valley (Maaseik, Liége), the Gete River valley (Herk-de-Stad and Halen) and southeast Brussels (Wavre). The Netherlands experienced ﬂooding, mostly concentrated in the southern district of Limburg. In total, at least 220 casualties have been reported, with insured loss estimates of approximately EUR 150 million–EUR 250 million in the Netherlands (Verbond voor Verzekeraars, 2022), ∼ EUR 2.2 billion in Belgium (Assuralia, 2022) and ∼ EUR 8.2 billion (GDV, 2022) in Germany. The event caused major damages to residential and commercial structures and to many critical infrastructure (CI) assets. Not only vital functions for ﬁrst responders were affected (e.g. hospitals, ﬁre departments), but also railways, bridges and utility networks (e.g. water and electricity supply) were severely damaged, expecting to take months to years to fully rebuild.\n",

Despite the (academic) agreement that failure of infrastructure systems may cause (large-scale) societal disruptions (Garschagen and Sandholz, 2018; Hallegatte et al., 2019; Fekete and Sandholz, 2021), empirical evidence on the impacts of extreme weather events on these systems is still\n",

More than 130 km of motorways were closed directly after the event, of which 50 km were still closed two months later, with an estimated repair cost of EUR 100 million (Hauser, 2021). Of the 112 bridges in the ﬂooded 40 km of the Ahr valley (Rhineland-Palatinate), 62 bridges were destroyed, 13 were severely damaged and only 35 were in operation a month after the ﬂood event (MDR, 2021). Over 74 km of roads, paths and bridges in the Ahr valley have been (critically) damaged. In some cases, repairs are expected to take months to years (Zeit Online, 2021). For example, major freeway sections, including parts of the A1 motorway, were closed until early 2022 (24Rhein, 2022). In addition, about 50 000 cars were damaged, causing insurance claims of some EUR 450 million (ADAC, 2021). The German railway provider Deutsche Bahn expects asset damages of around EUR 1.3 billion.

The less damaged stretches were functional again within 3 months, while some of the most damaged sections in the Ahr valley are expected to be ﬁnished by the end of 2025 (DB, 2022). In Belgium, approximately 10 km of railway tracks and 3000 sleeper tracks have to be replaced; 50 km of catenary needs to be repaired; and 70 000 t of railway track bed needs to be placed, with estimated costs between EUR 30 million–EUR 50 million (Rozendaal, 2021a). Most damages have been repaired within 2 weeks. The most severely damaged railway line (between the villages of Spa and Pepinster) was reopened again on 3 October 2021 (Rozendaal, 2021b).

Within 8 weeks, no emergency power generators were required anymore, with most of the power infrastructure restored in Germany’s affected areas. Some areas, however, only had permanent power infrastructure after 6 months (Westnetz, 2022). The gas distribution network in the Ahr valley was severely damaged. Approximately 133 km of natural gas pipelines, 8500 gas metres, 3400 house pressure regulators, 7220 of the approximately 8000 household connections, and 31 systems measuring and regulating gas pressure have been damaged or destroyed (SWR, 2021). Gas supply was almost fully restored within 4.5 months after the ﬂood event (Energienetze Mittelrhein, 2021). In Belgium, approximately 41 500 people experienced power outages at the peak of the event.

In Belgium, several towns experienced disruptions in water supply (in particular as a result of pollution). Directly after the event, approximately 3400 families had no access to potable water. Within less than a week, this was reduced to around 1650 families (Terzake, 2021). It took, however, 6 months to rebuild the permanent water supply infrastructure (SWDE, 2022).

Van Ginkel et al. (2021) assessed river ﬂood risk for all road segments in Europe. Of the eight motorway ﬂoods incidents in Germany reported by Hauser (2021), three are recognizable as ﬂood hotspots in van Ginkel et al. (2021). During the event in 2021, most damage was caused by relatively small rivers which are only represented in the hazard data from the point that the upstream catchment is above 500 km2. For example, the Ahr valley is partly covered (400 of the 900 km2) by van Ginkel et al., 2021, who estimate the road repair costs at EUR 4 million to EUR 29 million (under low- and high-ﬂow velocities respectively.) for a 1 : 500 year event.

After 5 months, broadband has also been restored in the most affected areas, which started in most areas only after power infrastructure was rebuilt (Westnetz, 2021). In Belgium, it has taken around 11 months to restore connection to the last communities within the affected area.

This was primarily due to ﬂooded telecommunication infrastructure in the direct vicinity of ﬂooded houses. However, some distribution cabinets were ﬂooded as well, with the largest ﬂooded cabinet affecting around 700 households. Due to damaged bridges, several ﬁbre cables were damaged.

Historical bridge designs concentrated primarily on cross-sectional requirements for expected water volumes. Triggered by ﬂood events in the past four decades, bridge design research has broadened by focusing on risk-based scour assessment, hydrodynamic pier designs, reduction of intermediate bridge support elements, impact and collision loading, implementation of bridge protection mechanisms such as from wood debris, and machine learning approaches from past failures (VAW 188, 2006; Bento et al., 2020; Majtan et al., 2021; Naser, 2021). Accounting for all these mechanisms, however, is complex (Haehnel and Daly, 2004) and no guarantee to avoid the observed failures.

In particular, when modelling the economic and societal impacts, the recovery process is one of the most important drivers of losses (e.g. Koks et al., 2015). The July 2021 event has given us several insights. Firstly, there is a prioritization between different infrastructure systems. In Germany, for example, we found that in several affected areas the electricity network was repaired ﬁrst, which was subsequently followed by the gas and broadband network. Secondly, there is a prioritization within infrastructure systems. For example, more critical roads are repaired sooner than less critical roads.

First, merely focusing on ﬂood extent and depth is not sufﬁcient to estimate the impacts of extreme ﬂood events to infrastructure. In particular, in Germany and Belgium, it became evident that the high discharge and stream-ﬂow and corresponding high-ﬂow velocities (resulting from the local topography and the intensity of the rainfall) are a decisive factor in explaining the degree of destruction. Many of the observed failures such as bridge scour, road embankment instabilities and erosion of aggregate foundations could likely better be explained from ﬂow velocity rather than ﬂood depth. Future ﬂood impact studies, especially those focusing on transport infrastructure, should aim to account for ﬂow velocity in their impact modelling, in particular in areas with steep gradients.\n",

Of the 112 bridges in the ﬂooded 40 km of the Ahr valley (Rhineland-Palatinate), 62 bridges were destroyed, 13 were severely damaged and only 35 were in operation a month after the ﬂood event (MDR, 2021). Over 74 km of roads, paths and bridges in the Ahr valley have been (critically) damaged. In some cases, repairs are expected to take months to years (Zeit Online, 2021). For example, major freeway sections, including parts of the A1 motorway, were closed until early 2022 (24Rhein, 2022). In addition, about 50 000 cars were damaged, causing insurance claims of some EUR 450 million (ADAC, 2021). The German railway provider Deutsche Bahn expects asset damages of around EUR 1.3 billion.
